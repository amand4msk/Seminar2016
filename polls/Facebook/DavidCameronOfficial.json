We do so today in very special circumstances. With the prospects for working people all across Britain at stake on 23 June, it is right that the rules of conventional politics be temporarily set aside. \n\nThere are, of course, many things on which the two of us disagree. But we are united in our conviction that Britain, and Britain’s workers, will be better off in a reformed Europe than out on our own.\n\nWhile staying in Europe offers workers in the UK the best prospects of rising prosperity, leaving poses what we call a triple threat: to working people’s jobs, to their wages and to the prices we all pay in the shops. Let us take each in turn.\n\nFirst, the risk to jobs. Even some prominent campaigners on the leave side are now agreed on this – leaving the European Union will cause an economic shock. Let’s be clear about what that means: an economic downturn; people losing their jobs and livelihoods; parents left unable to provide for their families. \n\nAn independent estimate by the accountancy firm PwC states that unemployment could rise to 8% by 2020, compared with just 5% if we stay in the EU.\n\nThat’s bad enough, but there would be a longer-term consequence too. As last week’s Treasury analysis showed, Britain’s GDP will be permanently lower than it would otherwise be – around 6% lower by 2030, the equivalent of £4,300 for every household in the country. \n\nSo let there be no doubt about what leaving the EU means: an immediate shock, and then a permanently poorer country.\n\nThat leads us to the second threat: wages. It’s clear there will be long-term damage for our country’s productivity, caused by the second-rate, more restrictive trade relationship we would have to try to negotiate if we left our home market of 500 million consumers. Less open trading leads to lower productivity.\n\nAnd we must be equally clear about what that means for working people: even if they keep their jobs, their wages will be lower than they would otherwise have been. That would be a disaster for working people, and it will be those industries that rely on exporting to Europe the most – manufacturing and services – that will be hit hardest.\n\nSo it doesn’t matter whether you work in a car plant, a factory, a shop or an office: the likelihood is that you would take home less money at the end of every month than if we had stayed in Europe. \n\nAnd let’s not forget that, while the two of us may disagree about quite how far this process should go, being in Europe has helped to deliver many of the crucial rights that underpin fairness at work. \n\nPaid holidays, maternity rights, equal treatment for the millions of people working part-time, protections for agency workers, even equal pay for women at work: all are guaranteed by Europe and all could be at risk if we left.\n\nOf course, slower growth will feed through to the public finances too. It would hit our tax revenues, generating less money to pay the wages of public sector workers such as nurses and teachers. So we face a vicious circle that will hurt the lowest-paid workers in every part of our economy – public and private sector alike.\n\nThe third threat is rising prices. It’s quite simple: most independent experts agree that leaving Europe would put pressure on the pound. Indeed, we’re seeing that pressure already as fears grow of Britain leaving the EU. A weak pound means more expensive goods and higher inflation, pushing up the prices of the weekly shop, clothes, petrol – anything that we import from other countries. \n\nSo we are likely to see the cost of living going up, just as wages are being squeezed and jobs lost. That is the threat for families already struggling to make ends meet – and a risk that working people and the poorest in our country simply cannot afford.\n\nSo the choice before us is becoming clearer each day. We can risk jobs, hold down wages and pay higher prices. We can be the first major economy in history to deliberately choose a second-rate trading arrangement for our biggest market. We can take needless risks with our economy that would unleash a triple threat to working people – and become a poorer country in every sense.\n\nOr, if we choose to stay in the EU, we can protect working people and the poorest families. We can choose stability and economic security – a bright future with more jobs, higher pay and lower prices.\n\nAs you make that choice, remember this: on the leavers’ side there is a real lack of credible experts to support their case. And there is a troubling dogma in their rigid belief that, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, taking these risks will be worth the pain they will cause. \n\nThe leavers now say they want the UK to be like Albania, which even the Albanian prime minister says is “weird”, because his country wants to be more like us.\n\nOn our side, however, we have a collection of independent experts, trustworthy organisations and friends of Britain from around the world. Whether it is the Bank of England, our universities, the trade unions, employers large and small in every part of our economy, the IMF, President Obama, our allies in Nato or the Commonwealth, the message is the same: Britain is better off in Europe.\n\nOf course, the leavers say this must be some sort of conspiracy masterminded by shadowy international elites. All we have to say is: to have been able to bring even the two of us together today, these evil geniuses must be very good.\n\nFor the sake of every worker in Britain, we urge you: vote to remain.\"","2016-04-28 16:01:46+00","653092548048400_1181888348502148",1],[16,"Good luck Team GB on the road to Rio - 100 days to go to the Summer Olympics. #BringOnTheGreat","2016-04-27 07:09:36+00","653092548048400_1181004088590574",1],[17,"Meeting the British Transport Police with Zac Goldsmith.

So let us properly examine the consequences for our economy. What would a new tailored arrangement, of the sort Canada or Switzerland have with Europe, mean for us?\n\nIf we take the Canada free trade deal as a guide, we know it would be damaging for agriculture and manufacturing. Our beef and pork exports would face tariffs, and our car manufacturers forced to comply with rules imposing additional costs based on where they buy their components.\n\nAnd, of course, there is British steel. We are doing everything we can to help British steel in these difficult times, but the idea that leaving Europe is the answer is a dangerous fallacy: more than half of our steel exports go to Europe. As Stephen Kinnock, the local MP has said, the last thing his constituents in Port Talbot need is to be cut off from Europe.\n\nLeaving the single market would also hit our service industries hard – and this is where our economy faces the biggest risk.\n\nToday, British brainpower and ingenuity are in demand. We’re the country that designs the building, advises on the deal, arranges the finance, insures the business, draws up the contracts, produces the film, creates the advertising campaign, sells the product and audits the accounts. All these are service industries.\n\nThe figures speak for themselves. Our service industries are growing at a rate of nearly three per cent a year on average. They account for almost 80 per cent of our economy. And they amount to 40 per cent of all British exports – with Europe being by far our biggest market. \n\nIndeed, an extraordinary 116,000 small businesses export services to the EU. And new analysis shows that two million jobs are either directly or indirectly linked to these exports.\n\nEach of these jobs represents someone with a pay packet; someone providing for themselves and their families. As politicians, we have a duty to tell them what we think the future holds. I can tell each of them, with certainty, that if we stay in Europe their employer will keep the current guaranteed rights to offer services anywhere in the EU.\n\nThose advocating leave can do no such thing. No real-world alternative to EU membership would come close to what we have now. Even the most ambitious trade deal on services the EU has ever struck – with Canada – falls radically short of single-market access.\n\nThe latest draft of the Canada deal runs to over 1,500 pages – 800 of which are reservations and barriers. A huge proportion of the deal is about restricting business opportunities, not opening them up. We could see new barriers for British business in every key services sector. \n\nHere are just three examples. One: aviation. Currently, UK airlines are free to operate routes both between and within other EU member states. But under their deal, Canadian airlines are only allowed to operate routes in Europe if they start or end at a Canadian airport. If this rule was applied to British airlines, they would have to scrap hundreds of routes.\n\nTwo: broadcasting. Under EU rules, once a broadcaster is licensed in one member state, it can broadcast in all. If we replicated Canada’s deal, companies would have to choose between seeking separate licences in all EU states they want to broadcast in, or moving out of the UK altogether.\n\nAnd of course, there’s our biggest service industry: financial services. Half of all international financial firms base their European headquarters in the UK. From their one office here, EU membership allows them to do business in all 27 other EU states. \n\nIf we left, this right would be lost and thousands of firms could be forced to move staff or entire offices out of the UK and into the EU, meaning fewer jobs and less tax revenue for the UK.\n\nPeople might say: “So what? Surely Britain will get a better deal than Canada or Switzerland? The EU needs Britain more than we need the EU.” That misunderstands the negotiation dynamics that would be at play. The EU buys £21 billion more of services from us – one country – than we buy from the 27 countries in the EU. \n\nIn fact, of everything we sell abroad, 44 per cent goes to the EU, but of everything the EU exports, less than 8 per cent comes to the UK. How can those dynamics be good for the UK?\n\nGovernments in the EU would come under tremendous pressure from their domestic firms to discriminate against the UK. And who is to say they wouldn’t take the opportunity? After all, why wouldn’t the Spanish protect their largest telecoms provider? Why wouldn’t the Germans try to give a leg-up to their insurance companies? Why wouldn’t France adopt protectionist measures to penalise British banks?\n\nWhen you look at the consequences of leaving this market, you have to ask: why on earth would we do this to ourselves? I believe it would be needless and reckless – an act of economic and political self-harm.\n\nIn June, we can choose Britain’s future. We can choose to shape our world, not to be shaped by others.

My article for the Sunday Telegraph:\n\nOn 23rd June, nothing less than the future of our country is at stake.\n \nIf you vote to remain in Europe, I can clearly describe what you’re voting for. Our trade links with a reformed Europe and the wider world will grow; we’ll keep on working with our neighbours to make our country safer; and Britain will continue to help set the rules of the market of 500 million people on our doorstep, and have a say over the future of the continent to which we are geographically tied. \n\nThat’s the picture of “in” – positive and definitive.\n \nInstead, when the people campaigning for “out” are asked to set out a vision outside the European Union, they become extremely vague. It’s simply not good enough to assert everything will be alright when jobs and our country’s future are at stake. \n\nThat’s why today I want to set out some of the specific questions those who would leave the European Union must answer. They don’t owe it to me; they owe it to us all, because at the moment what they are offering is a leap in the dark.\n \nThe first question is: what trading relationship would Britain have with Europe after leaving? Every country that’s been granted full access to the Single Market has had to pay into the EU, and accept free movement of people – but has no say over rules that govern those things.\n \nJust ask Norway; they pay roughly the same per head to the EU as Britain does, and they accept twice as many EU migrants, yet they have no say at the EU Council.\n \nAnother suggestion is to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement or similar with the EU, like Canada, Switzerland or Turkey. \n\nBut none of these countries has an agreement that is any way as comprehensive as the Single Market. That’s OK for them – around a tenth of Canada’s exports, for example, go to Europe; but around half of ours do. What’s more, Canada’s agreement, when it takes effect, will offer less access for services than we have now. But that sector makes up three-quarters of our economy. What would that mean for UK jobs in retail, insurance and creative industries?\n \nA final option is to fall back onto the World Trade Organisation for trade. But this could be crippling for our industries, as we’d have to accept tariffs that are sometimes as high as 50 per cent.\n \nThe second question is: how long would it take to put a new relationship in place – and how great would the uncertainty be for families and businesses in the meantime? It took Switzerland a decade to negotiate their current relationship with Europe, and Canada seven years – and theirs still hasn’t been implemented. \n\nOf course, those who advocate leaving Europe say we should just sign trade deals with other parts of the world. But how plausible is it that India, China or Brazil would sign a trade deal with us before they know what sort of new relationship we have with Europe?\n \nWhile all this wrangling goes on, there would be huge amounts of uncertainty, and it would have an impact on investment and trade – and, ultimately, your job, the prices you pay and your family’s finances.\n \nThe third question is about security. Today Britain has a whole set of arrangements with our European neighbours: the European Arrest Warrant, access to European criminal records, sharing information to stop terrorists coming to our country.\n \nDo those who want to leave support this network of security cooperation? If not, they need to spell out how they intend to keep people safe. \n\nDo they propose individual agreements with 27 countries? How long would that take? Or do they propose an agreement with the EU simply to opt back into all of the arrangements again? Surely that would mean – again – we would be subject to rules we would have no power over influencing – the complete opposite of sovereignty.\n \nFourth, there’s a bigger question about our role in the world: outside the EU, is Britain more able or less able to get things done? \n\nOf course, we’re a strong country. We’re the 5th largest economy in the world. We’ve got superb armed forces. But think of the things that have threatened us in recent years: the prospect of a nuclear Iran; Russian aggression in Ukraine; the overwhelming impact of the migration crisis; the poison of Islamist extremism and terrorism.\n \nEuropean countries have to work together to deal with them, and it is through the EU that Britain has helped drive Europe’s response. And they will remain issues if Britain leaves the EU. That doesn’t mean we can’t do things with NATO or with America – but there is a reason that our NATO allies want us to remain in the EU.\n \nThey can see clearly that our membership amplifies our power as a nation, and that now is not a time for disunity among Western nations.\n \nAs you consider these questions, bear in mind the process for leaving the EU, as set out in Article 50 of the European Treaty. A Leave vote would set the clock ticking on a two-year period to negotiate the terms of exit. \n\nIf we failed to reach an agreement, all 27 countries would have to approve an extension, or we’d fall back onto basic rules. That means that, without an extension, our full access to the Single Market ceases and our free trade agreements around the world lapse overnight.\n  \nA year ago, the Conservative election manifesto contained a clear commitment: security at every stage of your life. Britain is doing well. Our economy is growing; unemployment is falling to record lows.\n \nWe need to be absolutely sure, if we are to put all that at risk, that the future would be better for our country outside the EU than it is today.\n \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the only certainty of exit is uncertainty; that leaving Europe is fraught with risk. Risk to our economy, because the dislocation could put pressure on the pound, on interest rates and on growth. Risk to our cooperation on crime and security matters. And risk to our reputation as a strong country at the heart of the world’s most important institutions. \n\nWith so many gaps in the “out” case, the decision is clearly one between the great unknown and a greater Britain. \n\nA vote to leave is the gamble of the century. And it would be our children’s futures on the table if we were to roll the dice.","2016-02-28 10:12:54+00","653092548048400_1136556636368653",1],[68,"Great to launch ConservativesIn last night.

We want this government to be different. When we say we will tackle our deepest social problems and extend life chances, we want there to be no no-go areas. That includes the 121 prisons in our country, where our social problems are most acute and people’s life chances are most absent. \n\nOur starting point is this: we need prisons. Some people belong in them – punishment is not a dirty word. But we need a prison system that doesn’t see prisoners as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be harnessed. And the failure of our system today is scandalous. This failure really matters to the public purse, to victims, prison staff and prisoners themselves, who shouldn’t feel that society has totally given up them. \n\nSo we will create six new ‘reform prisons’ this year, with full autonomy over how they operate and spend their budget.

Instead there is a grown-up country that, despite our challenges, is largely at ease with the diversity of our open society. We also know what we are trying to achieve. Not a process of total assimilation, where people lose their whole identity. Nor is it “separate development” where we encourage — or even tolerate — communities living apart. But instead, we are in the process of building a common home together, where our shared British values should help us to live side by side. And we aim for a land where at last, everyone — no matter their gender, race, background or sexuality — can be accepted for who they are and expect to be treated with true equality.\n\nBut when you look more under the surface, it’s clear that we’ve still got some distance to travel to achieve the One Nation ideal. Consider this: if you’re a young black man, you’re more likely to be in a prison cell than studying at a top university. Only one in 10 of the poorest white boys go into higher education at all. There are no black generals in our armed forces and just 4% of chief executives in the FTSE 100 are from ethnic minorities.\n\nWhat does this say about modern Britain? Are these just the symptoms of class divisions or a lack of equal opportunity? Or is it something worse — something more ingrained, institutional and insidious? We’ve come a long way — including in my own party. When I became an MP in 2001, I barely had a single colleague from an ethnic minority background. Today our MPs include the sons, daughters and grandchildren of Ghanaians, east African Indians, Iranian dissidents, Pakistanis and Indians. But there is much more to do, and these examples I mention should shame our country and jolt us into action.\n\nSo what are we going to do? First, we’ve got to extend life chances. Last month I spoke about the subtle social inequality that can hold people back. It can start with poor parenting, and that damage can then be compounded in a poor or coasting school. And later, in adolescence, young people can lack access to vital, life-enriching experiences, mentors and support networks. We’ve got to think radically here — and with expanded parenting provision, teaching character in schools, and new mentoring and work experience programmes, I think we can rise to the challenge.\n\nBut improving life chances only gets you part of the way there. You can have a great start in life, but still be held back — often invisibly — because of your background or the colour of your skin. So the second thing we need to do is tackle discrimination. I don’t care whether it’s overt, unconscious or institutional — we’ve got to stamp it out. We don’t need politically correct, contrived and unfair solutions. Quotas don’t fix the underlying problems. To succeed, we must be far more demanding of our institutions, and be relentless in the pursuit of creative answers.\n\nOne area we should look at is the criminal justice system. It’s disgraceful that if you’re black, it seems you’re more likely to be sentenced to custody for a crime than if you’re white. We should investigate why this is and how we can end this possible discrimination. That’s why I have asked David Lammy MP to lead a review of the overrepresentation of black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the criminal justice system. And this will include possible sentencing and prosecutorial disparity.\n\nAnother area where we need action is our universities. It’s striking that in 2014, our top university, Oxford, accepted just 27 black men and women out of an intake of more than 2,500. I know the reasons are complex, including poor schooling, but I worry that the university I was so proud to attend is not doing enough to attract talent from across our country. And these problems go deep elsewhere, too: white British men from poor backgrounds are five times less likely to go into higher education than others.\nThere is a real chance to help nudge universities into making the right choices and reaching out in the right ways. For example, there was compelling evidence that people with ethnic-sounding names were less likely to get call-backs for jobs, even with the same qualifications. That’s why, last year, I persuaded universities and many other organisations to introduce name-blind applications.\n\nToday I can announce a further step. We intend to legislate to place a new transparency duty on universities to publish data routinely about the people who apply to their institution, the subject they want to study, and who gets offered a place. And this will include a full breakdown of their gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic background. And to focus minds further, Sajid Javid, the business secretary, will chair a summit tomorrow in Downing Street with schools and universities to help chart other ways forward.\n\nThis is all part of our ambitious “2020 agenda” for BME communities. Not just greater numbers at university, but many more jobs, apprenticeships and start-up loans. And I am determined to fix that stubborn problem of underrepresentation in our police and armed forces. To succeed, I want to issue a great call to arms to institutions all across our country. It’s not enough to simply say you are open to all. Ask yourselves: are you going that extra mile to really show people that yours can be a place for everyone, regardless of background? We can all dig deeper — but I’m confident we can get there. This is Britain; there’s nothing we can’t achieve together.\n\nWe have a claim to be the most successful multiracial, multifaith democracy on Earth. In Britain, the children and grandchildren of migrants sit at the cabinet table, run world-beating companies and win Oscars, Turner prizes and Olympic golds. But our relative success isn’t enough so long as there are young people who don’t feel like there’s a fair chance for them. Discrimination and disadvantage only feed those who preach a message of grievance and victimhood — and that makes building One Nation a harder and longer task. I want this to be the government that finally makes the difference. So let’s ask those big questions. Let’s find the solutions. Let us together finish the fight for real equality in Britain.","2016-01-31 11:39:46+00","653092548048400_1120325857991731",1],[83,"Congratulations to all the bakers on The Great British Bake Off for Sport Relief - it's a great cause.

my opening speech in the Commons debate:\n\nMr Speaker, I beg to move the motion on the order paper in my name and that of my Rt Hon Friends.\n\nThe question before the House today is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by ISIL.\n\nAnd Mr Speaker, let me be clear from the outset, this is not about whether we want fight terrorism, it’s about how best we do that.\n\nI respect that governments of all political colours in this country have had to fight terrorism and have had to take the people with them as they do so.\n\nAnd I respect people who come to a different view from the government and from the one I’ll set out in the House today, and those who vote accordingly.\n\nAnd I hope that provides some reassurance to members right across the House.\n\nMr Speaker, in moving this motion, I am not pretending that the answers are simple.\n\nThe situation in Syria is incredibly complex.\nI am not overstating the contribution that our incredible servicemen and women can make.\nNeither am I ignoring the risks of military action...\n...nor am I pretending that military action is any more than one part of the answer.\n\nI am absolutely clear that we must pursue a comprehensive strategy that also includes political, diplomatic and humanitarian action.\n\nAnd I know that the long term solution in Syria - as in Iraq - must ultimately be a government that represents all of its people...\n\n...and one that can work with us to defeat the evil organisation of ISIL for good.\nBut Mr Speaker, notwithstanding all of this, there is a simple question at the heart of the debate today.\n\nWe face a fundamental threat to our security.\n\nISIL have brutally murdered British hostages.\nThey’ve inspired the worst terrorist attack against British people since 7/7 on the beaches of Tunisia…\n…and they’ve plotted atrocity after atrocity on the streets here at home.\nSince November last year our security services have foiled no fewer than seven different plots against our people.\nSo this threat is very real.\n\nAnd the question is this: do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat?\n\nAnd do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands...\n\n...from where they are plotting to kill British people...\n\n...or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?\n\nIn answering this question we should remember that 15 months ago...\n\n...facing a threat from ISIL in Iraq...\n\n...this House voted 524 to 43 to authorise airstrikes in Iraq.\n\nSince then our brilliant RAF pilots have helped local forces to halt ISIL’s advance and recover 30% of the territory ISIL had captured.\n\nOn Monday I spoke to the President of Iraq in Paris and he expressed his gratitude for the vital work our forces are doing.\nAnd yet when our planes reach the border with Syria...\n\n...a border that ISIL themselves do not recognise...\n\n...we can no longer act to defend either his country – or our indeed country.\n\nEven when we know that ISIL’s headquarters are in Raqqah in Syria...\n\n...and it is from here that many of the plots against our country are formed.\n\nMr Speaker, we possess the capabilities to reduce this threat to our security.\n\nAnd my argument today is that we should not wait any longer before doing so.\n\nWe should answer the call from our allies.\n\nThe action we propose to take is legal...\n\n... it is necessary...\n\n...and it is the right thing to do to keep our country safe.\n\nAnd my strong view is House should make clear that our responsibilities rather than pass them off and put our own national security in the hands of others.\n\nNow Mr Speaker, since my Statement last week, the House has had an opportunity to ask questions of our security experts.\n\nI have arranged a briefing for all Members…\n…as well as more detailed briefings for Privy Councillors.\n\nI have spoken further to our allies – including President Obama, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande and the King of Jordan.\nThe King of Jordan has written in The Daily Telegraph today expressing his wish for Britain to stand with Jordan in eliminating this global threat.\n\nI have also listened carefully to the questions asked by Members on all sides of this House...\n\n...and I hope that Hon members can see the influence this House has had on the motion that stands before us.  \n\nThe stress on post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction, the importance of standing by our Allies, the importance of only targeting ISIL, not deploying ground troops in combat operations, to avoid civilian casualties, the importance of ceasefires and a political settlement, a commitment to regular updates to this House.\n\nI’ve drawn these points from across the House and put them in the motion because I want as many people as possible to feel able to support this action.\n\nIn my remarks, I want to address the most important points raised...\n...and I will of course take as many interventions as I can.\n\nMr Speaker, the key questions that have been raised are these.\n\nFirst, could acting in this way actually increase the risk to our security by making an attack on Britain more likely?\n\nSecond, does Britain really have the capability to make a significant difference?\n\nThird, the question asked by a number of Members – including the Hon. Member for Gordon – is why don’t we just increase our level of air strikes in Iraq...\n....to free up capacity amongst other members of the coalition, so they can carry out more air strikes in Syria.\n\nFourth, will there really be the ground forces needed to make this operation a success?\n\nFifth, what is the strategy for defeating ISIL and securing a lasting political settlement in Syria?\n\nAnd sixth, is there a proper reconstruction, post conflict stabilisation plan for Syria?\n\nI want to try in the time I’ve got available to answer all of these in turn.\n\nBut before we get on tot all these things, Mr Speaker, I want to say a word about the terminology we use to describe this evil death cult.\n\nHaving carefully considered the strong representations made to me by the Hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham...\n\n...and having listened to many Members of Parliament from across the House...\n\n...I feel it is time to join our key ally France, the Arab League, and other members of the International community in using as frequently as possible the terminology Daesh rather than ISIL.  \n\nBecause frankly this evil death cult is neither a true representation of Islam nor is it a State.\n\nLet me turn to the important questions.\n\nFirst, could acting increase the risk to our security?\n\nThis is one of the most important questions have to answer.\n\nMr Speaker, Privy Councillors and members from across the House have had a full briefing from the Chair of the independent Joint Intelligence Committee.\n\nObviously I can’t share all the classified material but I can say this.\n\nParis wasn’t just different because it was so close to us, or because it was so horrific in scale; as different because it showed the extent of terror planning from Daesh in Syria and the approach of sending people back from Syria to Europe.\n\nThis was if you like, the head of the snake in Raqqa in action.\n\nSo it’s not surprising in my view that the judgement of the Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee and the judgement of the Director General of the Security Service...\n...is that the risk of a similar attack in the UK is real and that that the UK is already in the top tier of countries on ISIL’s target list.\n\nSo let me be frank Mr Speaker.\n\nIf there is an attack on the UK in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it has happened because of our airstrikes.\n\nI do not believe that would be the case.\n\nDaesh have been trying to attack us for the last year – as we know from the seven different plots that our security services have foiled.\n\nThe terrorist threat level to the UK was raised to Severe last August in the light of the threat from Daesh, meaning an attack is highly likely.\n\n800 people – including families and children – have been radicalised to such an extent that they have travelled to this so-called caliphate.  \n\nThe House should be under no illusion: these terrorists are plotting to kill us, and to radicalise our children, right now.\n\nThey attack us because of who we are, not because of what we do.\n\nBut when it comes to the risks of taking military action...\n...the risks of inaction are far greater thank the risks of what I propose.\n\nNext, there are those who ask whether Britain conducting strikes in Syria will really make a difference.\n\nThis is a question that came up.\n\nI believe we can make a difference.\n\nI told the House last week about our dynamic targeting...\n\n...about our Brimstone missiles, about the RAPTOR pod on our tornadoes, and the intelligence gathering work of our REAPER drones.\n\nBut there is another way of putting this which I think is equally powerful.\n\nThere is, of course, in the coalition a lot of strike capability but when it comes to precision strike capability – whether covering Iraq or Syria – last week, the whole international Coalition had some 26 aircraft available.\n\nEight of those were British Tornadoes.\n\nSo typically, the UK actually represents between a quarter and a third of the international coalition’s precision bombing capability.\n\nAnd we also have about a quarter of the unmanned strike capability flying in the region.\n\nSo we have do have a significant proportion of high precision strike capability.\n\nThat’s why this decision is so important.\n\nSo the argument I was making is one reason why members of the international coalition – including President Obama and President Hollande who made these points to me personally…\n\n...they believe that British planes would make a real difference in Syria, just as they are already doing in Iraq.\n  \nIn many way, what I’ve just said I believe helps to answer the next question that some Members have asked…\n…about why we do not simply increase our level of air strikes in Iraq to free up other coalition capacity for strikes in Syria.\n\nWe have these capabilities that other Members of the Coalition want to benefit from.\n  \nAnd it makes absolutely no sense to stop using these capabilities at a border between Iraq and Syria that Daesh simply do not recognise or respect.\n\nIn fact, there was a recent incident in which Syrian opposition forces needed urgent support in their fight against Daesh.\n\nBritish tornadoes were eight minutes away just over the border in Iraq, no-one else was close.\n\nBut Britain couldn’t help, so the Syrian Opposition forces had to wait 40 minutes in a perilous situation while other Coalition forces were scrambled.\n\nNow that sort of delay, it endangers the lives of those fighting Daesh on the ground and frankly does nothing for our reputation with our vital allies.\n\nThere is a much more fundamental answer as to why we should carry out air strikes in Syria ourselves.\nAnd it’s this.\nIt is Raqqa in Syria that is the Headquarters of this threat to our security.\n\nIt is in Syria where they pump and sell the oil that does so much to help finance their evil acts.\n\nAnd as I’ve said, it is in Syria where many of the plots against our country are formed.\n\nLet me turn to the question of whether there will be the ground forces to make this operation a success.\n\nThose who say there aren’t as many ground troops as we would like...\n\n...and that they are not all in the right place...\n\n...they are correct.\n\nWe are not dealing with an ideal situation but let me make a series of, I think, important points.\n\nFirst, we should be clear what air strikes alone can achieve.\n\nWe don’t need ground troops to target the supply of oil which Daesh uses to fund terrorism.\n\nWe don’t need ground troops to hit Daesh’s headquarters, their infrastructure, their supply routes, their training facilities, their weapons supplies.\n\nIt’s clear that airstrikes can have an effect, as I’ve just said, with the issue of Khan and Hussain.\n\nSo irrespective of ground forces, our RAF can do serious damage to Daesh's ability right now to bring terror to our streets and we should give them our support.\n  \nAs I said last week, the full answer to the question of ground forces can’t be achieved until there is a new Syrian government that represents all the Syrian people...\n\n...not just Sunni, Shia and Alawite, but Christian, Druze and others.\n\nAnd it is this new government who will be the natural partners for our forces in defeating Daesh for good.\n\nBut there are some ground forces that we can work with in the meantime.\n\nLast week I told the House that we believe there are around 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters…\n\n…who do not belong to extremist groups…\n…and with whom we can co-ordinate attacks on Daesh.\nThe House will appreciate there are some limits on what I can say about these groups.\n\nNot least because I can’t risk the safety of these courageous people - who are being targeted daily by the Regime, or by Daesh, or by both.\n\nBut I know this is an area of great interest and concern for the House, so let me try and say a little more.\n\nThe 70,000 is an estimate from our independent Joint Intelligence Committee…\n…based on a detailed analysis, updated on a daily basis, and drawing on a wide range of open source and intelligence.\n\nOf these 70,000, the majority are from the Free Syrian Army.\n\nAlongside the 70,000, there are some 20,000 Kurdish fighters with whom we can also work.\n\nNow I’m not arguing – this is a crucial point – I am not arguing that all of these 70,000 are somehow ideal partners. Some though, left the Syrian army because of Assad’s brutality and they clearly can play a role in the future of Syria.\n\nAnd that is actually a view that is taken by the Russian’s as well, who are prepared to talk to these people.\n\nAnd those figures do not include a further 25,000 actual extremist fighters in groups which reject political participation and any co-ordination with non-Muslims…\n\nSo although they fight Daesh, they cannot and will not be our partners.\n\nBut, Mr Speaker, there are ground forces who will take the fight to Daesh…\n…and in many cases we can work with them and we can assist them.\n\nThird, if we don’t act now, we should be clear that there will be even fewer ground forces over time...\n...as Daesh will get even stronger.\n\nMy view, we simply cannot afford to wait.\n\nLet me turn to our overall strategy.\n\nAgain I set this out in the House last week.\n\nBut let me say a little more about each of the non-military elements....\n...counter-terrorism, counter-extremism, the political and diplomatic process and the vital humanitarian work that my Rt. Hon friend just referred to.\n\nOur counter-terrorism strategy gives Britain a comprehensive plan to prevent and foil plots at home...\n\n...and also to address the poisonous extremist ideology that is the root cause of the threat that we face.\n\nAs part of this I can announce today that we will establish a comprehensive review to root out any remaining funding of extremism within the UK.\n\nThis will examine specifically the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK...\n\n...including any overseas sources.\n\nAnd it will report to myself and My Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary next Spring.\n\nMr Speaker, I know there are some who suggest that military action could in some way undermine our counter-extremism strategy by radicalising British Muslims.\n\nSo let me take this head on.\n\nBritish Muslims are appalled by Daesh.\n\nThese women-raping, Muslim-murdering, mediaeval monsters - are hijacking the peaceful religion of Islam for their warped ends.\n\nAs the King of Jordan says in his article today:  these people are not Muslims they are outlaws from Islam.\n\nAnd we must stand with our Muslim friends here and around the world as they reclaim their religion from these terrorists.\n\nSo far from an attack on Islam...\n\n...we are engaged in a defence of Islam.\n\nAnd far from a risk of radicalising British Muslims by acting...\n\n...failing to act would actually be to betray British Muslims and the wider religion of Islam in its very hour of need.\n\nThe second part of our strategy is our support for the diplomatic and political process.\n\nLet me say a word about how this process can lead to the ceasefires between the Regime and Opposition that are so essential for the next stages of this political transition.\n\nIt begins with identifying the right people to put around the table.\n\nNext week we expect the Syrian regime to nominate a team of people to negotiate under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nOver the last 18 months political and armed opposition positions have converged.\n\nWe know the main groups and their ideas.\n\nAnd in the coming days Saudi Arabia will host a meeting for Opposition representatives in Riyadh.\n\nAnd the United Nations will take forwards discussions on steps towards a ceasefire...\n\n...including at the next meeting of the International Syria Support Group which we expect to take place before Christmas.\n\nThe aim is clear as I’ve said, a transitional government in six months, a new constitution and free elections within 18 months so I would argue that the key elements of a deal are emerging.\n\nCeasefires, opposition groups coming together, the regime looking at negotiations, the key players – America and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran and key regional players like Turkey all in the room together.\n\nAnd my argument is this, hitting Daesh doesn’t hurt this process, it helps this process which is the eventual goal.\n\nI set out for the House last week our support for refugees in the region…\n\n...and the extra £1 billion that we would be prepared to commit to Syria’s reconstruction...\n\n...and the broad international alliance that we would work with in that rebuilding phase.\n\nBut Mr Speaker, let us be clear.\n\nPeople will not return to Syria, if part of it is under the control of an organisation that enslaves Yazidis...\n\n...throws gay people off buildings...\n\n...beheads aid workers...\n\n...and forces children to marry before they are even 10 years old.\n\nSo we cannot separate the humanitarian work and the reconstruction work from dealing with Daesh itself.\n\nLet me turn in more detail to the plan for post conflict reconstruction to support a new Syrian government when it emerges.\n\nI have said we would be prepared to commit at least £1 billion to Syria’s reconstruction.\n\nThe initial priorities would be protection, security, stabilisation and confidence building measures...\n\n...including meeting basic humanitarian needs, such as education, health and shelter, and of course helping refugees to return.  \n\nNow over time the focus would shift to longer-term rebuilding of Syria’s shattered infrastructure...\n\n...harnessing the expertise of the International Financial Institutions and the private sector.\n\nAs I said last week, we are not in the business of trying to dismantle the Syrian state, or its institutions.\n\nWe would aim to allocate reconstruction funds against a plan agreed between a new inclusive Syrian government and the international community, once the conflict has ended.\n\nThat is the absolute key.\nMr Speaker, let me conclude. This is not 2003.\n\nWe must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction.\n\nAnd let’s be clear Mr Speaker, inaction does not amount to a strategy for our security or for the Syrian people.\n\nBut inaction is a choice. I believe it’s the wrong choice.\n\nWe face a clear threat.\n\nWe have listened to our allies.\n\nWe have taken legal advice.\n\nWe have a unanimous United Nations Resolution.\n\nWe have discussed our proposed action extensively at meetings of the National Security Council and Cabinet.\n\nI have responded personally to the detailed report of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\n\nWe have a proper motion before the House.\n\nAnd we are having a ten and a half hour debate today.\nNow in that spirit I look forward to the rest of the debate...\n\n...I look forward to listening to the contributions of Members on all sides of the House.\n\nBut I hope that at the end of it all...\n\n...the House will come together in large numbers for Britain to play its part in defeating these evil extremists...\n\n...and taking the action that is needed now to keep our country safe.\n\nIn doing so, I pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery and service of our inspirational armed forces....\n\n...who will once again put themselves in harm’s way to protect our values and our way of life.\n\nAnd I commend this motion to the House.","2015-12-02 14:13:04+00","653092548048400_1088361564521494",1],[125,"Why we must take action against ISIL in Syria as part of a wider strategy. My Commons statement:\n\nMr Speaker, I said I would respond personally to the Foreign Affairs Committee report on extending British military operations to Syria. I have done so today, and copies of my response have been made available to every Member of the House.\n\nThe Committee produced a comprehensive report that asked a series of important questions. I have tried to listen very carefully to the questions and views expressed by Members on both sides of the House, and I want to answer all the relevant questions today. There are different ways of putting them, but they boil down to this: why? Why us? Why now? Is what we are contemplating legal? Where are the ground troops to help us achieve our objectives? What is the strategy that brings together everything we are doing, particularly in Syria? Is there an end to this conflict, and is there a plan for what follows?\n\nLet me deal with each of those questions as directly as I can. First, why? The reason for acting is the very direct threat that ISIL poses to our country and to our way of life. ISIL has attacked Ankara, Beirut and, of course, Paris, as well as likely blowing up a Russian plane with 224 people on board. It has already taken the lives of British hostages, and inspired the worst terrorist attack against British people since 7/7, on the beaches of Tunisia—and, crucially, it has repeatedly tried to attack us right here in Britain. In the last 12 months, our police and security services have disrupted no fewer than seven terrorist plots to attack the UK, every one of which was either linked to ISIL or inspired by its propaganda, so I am in no doubt that it is in our national interest for action to be taken to stop it—and stopping it means taking action in Syria, because Raqqa is its headquarters.\n\nBut why us? My first responsibility as Prime Minister—and our first job in this House—is to keep the British people safe. We have the assets to do that and we can significantly extend the capabilities of the international coalition forces. That is one reason why members of the international coalition, including President Obama and President Hollande, have made it clear to me that they want Britain to stand with them in joining in air strikes in Syria, as well as Iraq. These are our closest allies, and they want our help.\n\nPartly, this is about our capabilities. As we are showing in Iraq, the RAF can carry out what is called “dynamic targeting”, whereby our pilots can strike the most difficult targets at rapid pace and with extraordinary precision, and provide vital battle-winning close air support to local forces on the ground. We have the Brimstone precision missile system, which enables us to strike accurately, with minimal collateral damage—something that even the Americans do not have. RAPTOR—the reconnaissance airborne pod for our Tornado aircraft—has no rival; it currently gathers 60% of the coalition’s entire tactical reconnaissance in Iraq, and it is also equipped for strikes. In addition, our Reaper drones are providing up to 30% of the intelligence in Syria, but they are not currently able to use their low-collateral, high-precision missile systems. We also have the proven ability to sustain our operations—not just for weeks, but, if necessary, for months into the future.\n\nOf course we have those capabilities, but the most important answer to the question, “Why us?”, is, I believe, even more fundamental: we should not be content with outsourcing our security to our allies. If we believe that action can help protect us, then, with our allies, we should be part of that action, not standing aside from it. From that moral point comes a fundamental question: if we will not act now, when our friend and ally France has been struck in this way, then our allies in the world can be forgiven for asking, “If not now, when?”\n\nThat leads to the next question: why now? The first answer to that is, of course, because of the grave danger that ISIL poses to our security—a danger that has clearly intensified in recent weeks—but there are additional reasons why action now is so important. Just look at what has changed—not just the attack in Paris, but the fact that the world has come together and agreed a UN Security Council resolution. There is a real political process under way. This could lead to a new Government in Syria, with whom we can work to defeat ISIL for good. But as I explained to the House yesterday, we cannot wait for that to be complete before we begin acting to degrade ISIL and reducing its capability to attack us.\n\nLet us be clear about the military objectives that we are pursuing. Yes, we want to defeat the terrorists by dismantling their networks, stopping their funding, targeting their training camps and taking out those plotting terrorist attacks against the UK, but there is a broader objective. For as long as ISIL can pedal the myth of a so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, it will be a rallying call for Islamist extremists all around the world, and that makes us less safe. Just as we have reduced the scale and size of the so-called caliphate in Iraq—increasingly pushing it out of Iraq—so we need to do the same thing in Syria.\n\nIndeed, another reason for action now is that the success in Iraq in squeezing the so-called caliphate is put at risk by our failure to act in Syria. This border is not recognised by ISIL, and we seriously hamper our efforts if we stop acting when we reach the Syrian border, so when we come to the question, “Why now?”, we have to ask ourselves whether the risks of inaction are greater than the risks of taking action. Every day we fail to act is a day when ISIL can grow stronger and more plots can be undertaken. That is why all the advice I have received—the military advice, the diplomatic advice and the security advice—all says, yes, that the risks of inaction are greater.\n\nSome have asked specifically whether taking action could make the UK more of a target for ISIL attacks, so let me tell the House that the judgment of the director general of the Security Service and the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that the UK is already in the top tier of countries that ISIL is targeting, so I am clear that the only way to deal with that reality is to address the threat we face, and to do so now.\n\nLet me turn to the question of legality. It is a long-standing constitutional convention that we do not publish our formal legal advice, but the document I have published today shows in some detail the clear legal basis for military action against ISIL in Syria. It is founded on the right of self-defence as recognised in article 51 of the United Nations charter. The right of self-defence may be exercised individually where it is necessary to the UK’s own defence, and of course collectively in the defence of our friends and allies.\n\nThe main basis of the global coalition’s actions against ISIL in Syria is the collective self-defence of Iraq. Iraq has a legitimate Government—one that we support and help. There is a solid basis of evidence on which to conclude, first, that there is a direct link between the presence and activities of ISIL in Syria and its ongoing attack on Iraq, and secondly, that the Assad regime is unwilling and/or unable to take action necessary to prevent ISIL’s continuing attack on Iraq, or indeed attacks on us. It is also clear that ISIL’s campaign against the UK and our allies has reached the level of an “armed attack”, such that force may lawfully be used in self-defence to prevent further atrocities being committed by ISIL.\n\nThis is further underscored by the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2249. We should be clear about what this resolution means and what it says. The whole world came together, including all five members of the Security Council, to agree this resolution unanimously. The resolution states that ISIL\n\n“constitutes a global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security”.\n\nIt calls for member states to take “all necessary measures” to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by ISIL and, crucially, it says that we should\n\n“eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria”.\n\nTurning to the question of which ground forces will assist us, in Iraq the answer is clear. We have the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish peshmerga. In Syria, the situation is more complex. However, as the report I am publishing today shows, we believe that there are around 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters, principally of the Free Syrian Army, who do not belong to extremist groups, and with whom we can co-ordinate attacks on ISIL.\n\nIn addition, Kurdish armed groups have shown themselves capable of taking territory, holding it and administering it, and, crucially, of relieving the suffering that the civilian population had endured under ISIL control. The Syrian Kurds have successfully defended Kurdish areas in northern Syria and retaken territory around the city of Kobane.\n\nModerate armed Sunni Arabs have proved capable of defending territory north of Aleppo. They stopped ISIL’s attempts to capture the main humanitarian border crossing with Turkey and sweep into Idlib province. In the south, the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army has consolidated its control over significant areas, and has worked to prevent terrorists from operating.\n\nThe people I have talked about are ground troops. They need our help; when they get it, they succeed, so in my view, we should do more to help from the air. Those who ask questions about ground troops are absolutely right to do so. The full answer cannot be achieved until there is a new Syrian Government who represent all the Syrian people—not just Sunni, Shi’a and Alawite, but Christian, Druze and others. It is this new Government who will be the natural partner for our forces in defeating ISIL for good. We cannot defeat ISIL simply from the air, or purely with military action alone. It requires a full political settlement. The question is: can we wait for that settlement before we take action? Again, my answer is no.\n\nOn the question of whether this action is part of an overall strategy, the answer is yes. Our approach has four pillars. First, our counter-extremism strategy means that we have a comprehensive plan to prevent and foil plots at home, and to address the poisonous extremist ideology that is the root cause of the threat we face. The second pillar is our support for the diplomatic and political process. We should be clear about that process. Many people across this House have rightly said how vital it is to have all the key regional players around the table, including Iran and Russia. We are now seeing Iran and Saudi Arabia sitting around the same table as America and Russia, as well as France, Turkey and Britain. All of us are working towards the transition to a new Government in Syria.\n\nThe third pillar is the military action that I am describing to degrade ISIL and reduce the threat it poses; it is working in Iraq, and I believe that it can work in Syria. The fourth pillar is immediate humanitarian support and, even more crucially, longer-term stabilisation. The House has heard many times that Britain has so far given over £1.1 billion—by far the largest commitment of any European country, and second only to the United States of America. That is helping to reduce the need for Syrians to attempt the perilous journey to Europe. The donor conference that I am hosting in February together with Germany, Kuwait, Norway and the UN will help further.\n\nThe House is rightly asking more questions about whether there will be a proper post-conflict reconstruction effort to support a new Syrian Government when they emerge. Britain’s answer to that question is absolutely yes. I can tell the House that Britain would be prepared to contribute at least another £1 billion for that task.\n\nAll these elements—counter-terrorism, political and diplomatic, military and humanitarian—need to happen together to achieve a long-term solution in Syria. We know that peace is a process, not an event. I am clear that it cannot be achieved through a military assault on ISIL alone; it also requires the removal of Assad through a political transition. But I am also clear about the sequencing that needs to take place. This is an ISIL-first strategy.\n\nWhat of the end goal? The initial objective is to damage ISIL and reduce its capacity to do us harm. I believe that that can, in time, lead to its eradication. No one predicted ISIL’s rise, and we should not accept that it is somehow impossible to bring it to an end. It is not what the people of Iraq and Syria want; it does not represent the true religion of Islam; and it is losing ground in Iraq, following losses in Sinjar and Baiji.\n\nWe are not naive about the complexity of the task. It will require patience and persistence, and our work will not be complete until we have reached our true end goal, which is having Governments in both Iraq and Syria who can command the confidence of all their peoples. In Syria, that ultimately means a Government without Assad. As Ban Ki-moon has said:\n\n“Missiles may kill terrorists. But good governance kills terrorism.”\n\nThat applies so clearly to both Iraq and Syria.\n\nAs we discuss all these things, people also want to know that we have learned the lessons of previous conflicts. Whatever anyone thought of the Iraq war, terrible mistakes were made in its aftermath in dismantling the state and the institutions of that country. We must never make those mistakes again. The political process in Syria will, in time, deliver new leadership, and we must support that transition. We are not in the business of dismantling the Syrian state or its institutions.\n\nIn Libya, the state and its institutions had been hollowed out after 40 years of dictatorship. When the dictatorship went, the institutions rapidly collapsed. The big difference between Libya and Syria is that in Syria this time we have firm international commitment from all the backers of a future Syrian Government around the table at the Vienna talks. The commitment is clear: to preserve and develop the state in Syria, and allow a new representative Government to govern for all its people.\n\nI have attempted to answer the main questions: why? Why now? Why us? Is it legal? What are the ground forces? Is there a strategy? What is the end point and plan for reconstruction? I know that this is a highly complex situation, and Members on all sides of the House will have other questions that I look forward to trying to answer this morning.\n\nOne question will be about the confused and confusing situation in Syria with regard to Russia’s intervention. Let me reassure the House that the American-led combined air operations centre has a memorandum of understanding with the Russians. That enables daily contact and pragmatic military planning to ensure the safety of all coalition forces, and that would include our brave RAF pilots. Another question will be about whether we are taking sides in a Sunni versus Shi’a conflict, but that is simply not the case. Yes, ISIL is a predominantly Sunni organisation, but it is killing Sunni and Shi’a alike. Our vision for the future of Syria, as with Iraq, is not a sectarian entity, but one that is governed in the interests of all its people. We therefore wholeheartedly welcome the presence of states with both Sunni and Shi’a majorities at the Vienna talks, and their support for international action both against ISIL and towards a diplomatic solution in Syria.\n\nThe House will also want to know what we are doing about the financing of ISIL.\n\nThe document sets that out; it includes intercepting smugglers, sealing borders, and enforcing sanctions to stop people trading with ISIL. Ultimately, ISIL is able to generate income through its control of territory, so although we are working with international partners to squeeze the finances wherever we can, it is the rolling back of ISIL’s territory that will ultimately cut off its finances.\n\nTwo of the most complex questions in an undoubtedly complex situation are these.\n\nFirst, will acting against ISIL in Syria help to bring about transition? I believe the answer is yes, not least because there cannot be genuine transition without maintaining the territorial integrity of Syria. With its current actions, ISIL completely denies that integrity. Crucially, destroying ISIL helps the moderate forces, and those moderate forces will be crucial to Syria’s future. Secondly, does our view that Assad must go help in the fight against ISIL, or—as some claim—does that confuse the picture? The expert advice that I have could not be clearer: we will not beat ISIL if we waiver in our view that ultimately Assad must go. We cannot win over majority Sunni opinion, which is vital for the long-term stability of Syria, if we suddenly to change our position.\n\nIn the end it comes back to one main question: should we take action? All those who say that ultimately we need a diplomatic solution and a transition to a new Government in Syria are right. Working with a new representative Government is the way to eradicate ISIL in Syria in the long term, but can we wait for that to happen before we take military action? I say we cannot.\n\nLet me be clear: there will not be a vote in this House unless there is a clear majority for action, because we will not hand a publicity coup to ISIL.\n\nI am also clear that any motion we bring before this House will explicitly recognise that military action is not the whole answer. Proud as I am of our incredible servicemen and women, I will not pretend or overstate the significance of our potential contribution. I will not understate the complexity of this issue, nor the risks that are inevitably involved in any military action, but we do face a fundamental threat to our security. We cannot wait for a political transition. We have to hit these terrorists in their heartlands right now: and we must not shirk our responsibility for security, or hand it to others.\n\nThroughout our history, the United Kingdom has stood up to defend our values and our way of life. We can, and we must, do so again. I commend this statement to the House.","2015-11-26 13:25:29+00","653092548048400_1085620321462285",1],[126,"Today's Autumn Statement delivers our election commitments.

So I want the British people to know they have a government that understands the importance of our national security and that we will take whatever actions are necessary to keep our country safe.\n\nThis is not a time to equivocate about allowing our police to shoot a terrorist to save the lives of innocent people. It is not a time to stand back and wish for another world where Jihadi John or Reyaad Khan could somehow be arrested, rather than stopped in their tracks. Neither is it a moment to question our support for our dedicated security and intelligence services, who risk their lives day in and day out – often necessarily without any recognition – in order to keep us safe.\n\nSo later in Parliament I am setting out our Strategic Defence and Security Review, a comprehensive plan to back our Armed Forces, counter-terrorism police and intelligence agencies with the resources they need to defeat this terrorism and to tackle the many other threats we face in a world that is ever more dangerous and uncertain.\n\nEconomic security and national security go hand in hand. So at the heart of our strategy is our decision to see through our long-term economic plan and use our renewed economic strength to invest further in our security. As a result, the United Kingdom will be the only major country in the world which is simultaneously going to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of our GDP on defence and the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of our GNI on development, while also increasing investment in our security and intelligence agencies and in counter-terrorism.\n\nWe will use this comprehensive investment to cover the full spectrum of measures needed. This includes a real focus on tackling the causes of the threats we face – not just their consequences. So we will tackle the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism and refocus our aid budget to support fragile and broken states and regions, to prevent conflict and promote the golden thread of conditions that drive prosperity across the world: the rule of law, good governance and the growth of democracy.\n\nOur strategy includes deepening our resources and international co-operation on counter-terrorism to detect and foil plots from wherever they emanate in the world. So along with 1,900 new staff for our agencies and increased investment in counter-terrorism police, we will make a major new investment in a new generation of surveillance drones.\n\nThese British-designed unmanned aircraft will fly at the very edge of the earth’s atmosphere and allow us to observe our adversaries for weeks on end, providing critical intelligence for our forces. As part of our historic partnership, under the Lancaster House Treaty, we also intend to make a significant joint investment with France in developing unmanned combat air vehicles.\n\nThe bottom line of our National Security Strategy must always be the willingness and capability to use force where necessary. On Friday evening the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed Resolution 2249, calling on member states to take “all necessary measures” against Isil in both Syria and Iraq, and the “global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security” Isil represents.\n\nIn the coming days, I will respond personally to the foreign affairs select committee, making the case for Britain to join our international allies in going after Isil at their headquarters in Syria, not just Iraq. We cannot leave the burden and risks of protecting our country to others. Such action would be one key element of a comprehensive, long-term strategy to defeat Isil, in parallel with a major international effort to bring an end to the war in Syria.\n\nFor this and for any other tasks that may arise in future, this Government will ensure that our Armed Forces always have the capabilities they need. Over the last five years we have reconfigured Britain’s Armed Forces so they are able to deal with modern and evolving threats. Over the next decade we will invest more than £178 billion in buying and maintaining equipment – including doubling our investment in equipment to support our Special Forces. We will create two new strike brigades, forces of up to 5,000 personnel each, fully equipped to deploy rapidly and sustain themselves in the field.\n\nWe will establish two additional Typhoon squadrons and an additional squadron of F35 Lightning combat aircraft to operate from our new aircraft carriers. And we will invest in nine maritime patrol aircraft to protect our nuclear deterrent, hunt down hostile submarines and enhance our maritime search and rescue. Not one of these capabilities is an optional extra or an act of vanity. These investments are an act of clear-eyed self-interest to ensure our prosperity and security.\n\nBritain is fortunate to have some of the finest Armed Forces, counter-terrorism police and security services in the world. This Government will ensure they stay that way. Using our renewed economic strength, we will equip them to defeat the terrorist threat and help keep us safe for generations to come.","2015-11-23 08:11:03+00","653092548048400_1084042901620027",1],[81,"This morning I welcomed world leaders to the Syria conference in London:\n\nA warm welcome to London - and on behalf of my co-hosts Chancellor Merkel, Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Prime Minister Solberg, and His Highness the Amir of Kuwait - thank you for your support today.\n\nWe could not have a stronger gathering to address one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time.

My article for this morning's The Times:\n\nWhere in the world do you think the following things are happening? School governors’ meetings where male governors sit in the meeting room and the women have to sit out of sight in the corridor. Young women only allowed to leave their house in the company of a male relative. Religious councils that openly discriminate against women and prevent them from leaving abusive marriages.\n\nThe answer, I’m sorry to say, is Britain. Last week, I chaired a meeting of a group of brilliant Muslim women role models. And while I heard great examples of so many women who are flourishing in our country, some painted an alarming picture of forced gender segregation, discrimination and social isolation from mainstream British life.\n\nOf course, this does not describe the life of every British Muslim woman. Nor are these problems unique to Muslim communities. And it cannot be said often enough that the fear of Islamophobic hate crime – for instance, the disgraceful pulling of women’s headscarves in the street – is widespread and incredibly threatening, as well as being completely disempowering for women. But these problems are being consistently brought to our attention by Muslim women, and we have a duty to them to speak out – and to act.\n\nThat must begin by understanding the root causes. Some are, of course, cultural. But the standing rebuke to our society is that we have allowed this to continue. All too often, because of what I would call “passive tolerance”, people subscribe to the flawed idea of separate development. Ed Husain put it brilliantly last week when he said that our political correctness stops us from identifying this separatist mentality – terming it “the racism of low expectations”. It helps explain why, for instance, some so-called progressive politicians see fit to host gender-segregated political meetings.\n\nIt is time to change our approach. We will never truly build One Nation unless we are more assertive about our liberal values, more clear about the expectations we place on those who come to live here and build our country together and more creative and generous in the work we do to break down barriers. And this is a challenge that government cannot meet on its own.  I do want every part of government to play its part – health visitors, job centres, nurseries, schools – but we all have a shared responsibility to tackle prejudice and bigotry, and help integration.  \n\nWhy does this matter so much? Because we don’t just need a strong economy to thrive, we have to build a strong society. Segregation drives us apart, not together. And tolerating the development of parallel communities can also mean failing to get to grips with appalling practices like FGM and forced marriage. \n\nThere is also an important connection to extremism. I am not saying separate development or conservative religious practices directly cause extremism. That would be insulting to many who are devout and peace-loving. But they can help a young person’s slide towards radicalisation. Think about the young boy growing up in Bradford. His parents came from a village in Pakistan. His mum can’t speak English and rarely leaves the home, so he finds it hard to communicate with her, and she doesn’t understand what is happening in his life. At the same time, as a teenager he is struggling to identify with Western culture. Separate development and accepting practices that go against our values only emphasise differences and can help prompt the search of something to belong to. When that happens, the extremist narrative gives him something – however ridiculous – to believe in.\n\nSo what can we do about this? First, we need some clear thinking. This is Britain. In this country, women and girls are free to choose how they live, how they dress and who they love. It’s our values that make this country what it is, and it’s only by standing up for them assertively that they will endure. In Britain, men are not frightened of women’s success; it is celebrated proudly. So we must take on the minority of men who perpetuate these backward attitudes and exert such damaging control over their wives, sisters and daughters. And we must never again allow passive tolerance to prevent us from telling the hard truths.\n\nWe also need a clear and positive policy agenda. So we will review the role of religious councils, including Sharia councils. We’re teaching British values in our schools because I want every young boy and girl growing up here to feel proud of our country and properly connected to it. And we’ll end the forced gender segregation, as we issue clear guidance to local authorities to stamp out this practice. \n\nWe must also make more progress on English language. It is at the heart of solving this. Consider this: new figures show that some 190,000 British Muslim women – or 22 per cent – speak little or no English despite many having lived here for decades. 40,000 of these women speak no English at all. So it’s no surprise that sixty per cent of women of a Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage are economically inactive. \n\nThis has to be tackled head on. We’ve already introduced a language test for new migrants, but I believe it’s time to be much more demanding. Yes, we have responsibilities to migrants, but they have responsibilities too. At the moment, someone can move here with very basic English and there’s no requirement to improve it over time. We will change that. We will now say: if you don’t improve your fluency, that could affect your ability to stay in the UK. This will help make it clear to those men who stop their partners from integrating that there are consequences.\n\nWe’ll also fund a dramatic improvement in the way we provide English language services for women. With a new £20m programme, we’ll make sure every woman from isolated communities with no English at all has access to classes, whether through community groups or FE colleges. \n\nBritain has a claim to be the most successful multi-faith, multi-racial democracy on the planet. We got here because we fought and won those long struggles for liberty, equality and mutual tolerance. But the job of building a more cohesive country is never complete. With English language and women’s empowerment as our next frontier, I believe we can bring Britain together and build the stronger society that is within reach.","2016-01-18 09:03:36+00","653092548048400_1113241935366790",1],[95,"David Bowie was someone who people of my age, and those quite a bit older, felt we grew up with.

As I said three months ago in Manchester, a central part of my second-term agenda is to wage an all-out assault on poverty and disadvantage. And tomorrow I will set out our plan to extend life chances across Britain and really get to grips with the deep social problems — the blocked opportunity, poor parenting, addiction and mental health problems — that mean so many are unable to fulfil their potential.\n\nThere’s one issue that brings together many of these social problems and, for me, epitomises both the scale of the challenge we face and the nature of state failure over decades. It’s our housing estates. Some of them, especially those built just after the war, are actually entrenching poverty in Britain — isolating and trapping many of our families and communities. I remember campaigning in London as far back as the 1980s in bleak, high-rise buildings, where some voters lived behind padlocked and chained-up doors. In 2016, for too many places, not enough has changed.\n\nOf course, within these so-called sink estates, behind front doors, families build warm and welcoming homes. But step outside in the worst estates and you’re confronted by concrete slabs dropped from on high, brutal high-rise towers and dark alleyways that are a gift to criminals and drug dealers. The police often talk about the importance of designing out crime, but these estates designed it in. Decades of neglect have led to gangs, ghettos and antisocial behaviour. And poverty has become entrenched, because those who could afford to move have understandably done so.\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of these estates is just how cut off, self-governing and divorced from the mainstream these communities can become. In some places, there is severe social segregation and it damages us all when communities simply don’t come into contact with one another. And that allows social problems to fester and grow unseen. The riots of 2011 didn’t emerge from within terraced streets or low-rise apartment buildings. As spatial analysis of the riots has shown, the rioters came overwhelmingly from these postwar estates. Almost three-quarters of those convicted lived within them. That’s not a coincidence.\n\nAs we tackle this problem, we should learn the lessons from the failed attempts to regenerate estates in the past. A raft of pointless planning rules, local politics and tenants’ concerns about whether regeneration would be done fairly all prevented progress. And if we’re honest, there often just wasn’t the political will and momentum in government to cut through all of this to get things done.\n\nSo what’s our plan? Today I am announcing that we will work with 100 housing estates in Britain, aiming to transform them. A new advisory panel will help to galvanise our efforts and its first job will be to build a list of postwar estates across the country that are ripe for redevelopment, and work with up to 100,000 residents to put together regeneration plans.\n\nFor some, this will simply mean knocking them down and starting again. For others, it might mean changes to layout, upgrading facilities and improving local road and transport links. The panel will also establish a set of binding guarantees for tenants and homeowners so that they are protected.\n\nTo finance this, we’ll establish a new £140m fund that will pump-prime the planning process, temporary rehousing and early construction costs. And we’ll publish an estates regeneration strategy that will sweep away the planning blockages and take new steps to reduce political and reputational risk for projects’ key decision makers and investors.\n\nThere’s a second critical by-product of our plan. Tomorrow a report from Savills will show that this kind of programme could help to catalyse the building of hundreds of thousands of new homes in London alone. This is because existing estates were built at a lower density than many modern developments — poorly laid-out, with wasted open space that was neither park nor garden. So regeneration will work best in areas where land values are high, because new private homes, built attractively and at a higher density, will fund the regeneration of the rest of the estate.\n\nFor decades, sink estates — and frankly, sometimes, the people who lived in them — had been seen as something simply to be managed. It’s time to be more ambitious on every level. The mission here is nothing short of social turnaround, and with massive estate regeneration, tenants protected and land unlocked for new housing all over Britain, I believe that together we can tear down anything that stands in our way.","2016-01-10 08:12:18+00","653092548048400_1108831449141172",1],[100,"This Government is helping hardworking people buy affordable homes.

With a lower deficit and enterprise flourishing, our economy is becoming more secure by the day. With our commitment to increase defence spending and invest in new jets, frigates and armoured vehicles, our brilliant Armed Forces are keeping our nation safe. And having spent the last five years bringing excellence to our schools and reforming welfare, we are extending new opportunities across our country.\n\nFor me, there are no New Year’s resolutions, just the resolve to continue delivering what we promised in our manifesto. The prospects are good. We go into this year with low inflation, rising employment and growth. The question is: what do we do with that? Our answer is: we make Britain greater by giving its people even greater security. So this April, the tax cuts we pledged will start to come into effect and the elderly will get the biggest increase in the state pension for over a decade. We’ll take steps towards three million apprenticeships, 500 new Free Schools, more free childcare, and record levels of funding for the NHS. And we’ll stand ready to prevent and respond to any threat that comes our way. As I saw for myself this week, the weather can have a devastating impact on homes, livelihoods and whole communities. Because of our competent management of the economy, we are not only able to fund the necessary flood defences, emergency services and support; we can actually be flexible about what we spend and where we spend it. So when we face unprecedented and unexpected flooding we are able to give help to families when they need it.\n\nWe also promised something else in our manifesto: giving the British people a say on our relationship with Europe. We’re fighting hard to fix the aspects of our EU membership that cause so much frustration in Britain – so we get a better deal for our country and secure our future. It is a difficult negotiation with 27 other countries. But throughout we are driven by one consideration: what is best for Britain’s economic and national security. In the end, you will decide whether we are stronger and better off with our European neighbours as part of the European Union, or on our own.\n\nBut as we deliver our manifesto, I want to go further, opening up new areas of social reform. I genuinely believe we are in the middle of one of the great reforming decades in our history – what I would call a “turnaround decade”, where we can use the platform of our renewed economic strength to go for real social renewal. So here are the things I want to get done.\n\nOne: home ownership. It is not just an economic outrage, but a moral one that hardworking young people are priced out of the housing market. With Right to Buy and Help to Buy, we have helped people onto the housing ladder. In the next five years, Britain needs to get building. We doubled the annual housing budget in the Spending Review; we will build 200,000 Starter Homes; and if local councils can’t get their act together and build the homes their areas need, we will intervene directly.\n\nTwo: poverty. We have taken great leaps in recent decades, but stubborn and persistent poverty still exists. So we need a more targeted strategy for those most in need of help, focusing on tackling the root causes like worklessness and family instability. And as we develop our Life Chances Strategy this spring, I want us to move further on addiction and mental health, especially in prison, and to rescue more children from being stuck in failing care systems. That’s why, in the next five years, our reforms to social services will be as radical as the reforms to our schools.\n\nThree: social mobility. We live in a country where too many people are stopped from reaching their potential because of their background. Of course, education and training are crucial here. But discrimination, sadly, still exists in our country. So we’ll step up our effort to complete the fight for equality with, for example, more work to close the gender pay gap, with a new strategy set out in the New Year.\n\nFour: extremism. This is one of the biggest issues facing our country. Of course, we need to tackle the hate preachers and take down the online material that radicalises so many. But we also need to address the issues that for too long have been swept under the carpet. Failure to integrate, the dangers of segregation and deprivation, women treated as second-class citizens, communities living side by side but never coming into contact with each other – these will all be issues that Louise Casey will address in her review for the Government later this year, and we will respond with vigour.\n\nIf we really get to grips with these problems this year, we won’t just be a richer nation, but a stronger, more unified, more secure one. It won’t be easy. These problems have been generations in the making. And many of them are tangled together. Just consider this. Right now, there are more young black men in prison than studying at our top universities. That scandal brings together so many of these problems I have spoken about: poor life chances that, though they never excuse a life of crime, often find people heading down that track; poor schooling, because that holds people back; discrimination, because there is even evidence to suggest that men from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to get a custodial sentence than white men; and extremism, which sometimes is even incubated in state institutions, such as prisons.\n\nFacts like this show that our social problems aren’t just ingrained; they’re enmeshed with one another. So yes, we’re going to spend this year delivering the education, training, jobs, tax cuts, healthcare and housing people need. But we’re also going to make sure no-one should be on the outside looking in at all these things – that everyone is a part of Britain’s rise. In doing so, we can make 2016 a game changer for our country.\n\nThere are many people who will tell you how deeply they care about these issues. They will shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions. But we’re the ones who are able to make the arguments and take the difficult decisions in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security. So while others are on protest march, we remain on the long walk to a Greater Britain. We won’t get there overnight. But during 2016, we will make some of our most significant strides yet.","2016-01-01 17:03:45+00","653092548048400_1104215029602814",1],[104,"Happy New Year!","2016-01-01 00:00:59+00","653092548048400_1103789459645371",1],[107,"My thoughts are with people whose homes have been flooded.

The talks at the COP21 conference in Paris have culminated in a global deal, with every country in the world now signed up to play its part in halting climate change. In other words, this generation has taken vital steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren will see that we did our duty in securing the future of our planet.\n\nIn my speech on the opening day of the conference, I set out the things I believed were needed to make this a good deal. I said it would have to ensure the world’s temperature would not rise more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In fact, the deal pledges to keep global warming “well below” that figure – just as Britain had been calling for. I said it would have to be legally binding – and it will be. I said it would have to come with regular reviews; help for the poorest in the world; and a transfer of technology from the richest to the poorest nations. It does all those things.\n\nWhat is so special about this deal is that it puts the onus on every country to play its part. Britain has already been leading the way in that. For example, last year, in anticipation of the Paris talks, we led on securing the historic agreement with the rest of the European Union to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. We’re also the first country in the world to run a Green Investment Bank, dedicated to greening the economy. A few weeks ago, we even committed to ending unabated coal-fired power in this country.\n\nBut there is only so far we can go by getting our own emissions down. It is developing countries’ action that makes the real difference. But the problem is these are also the nations that can’t afford to invest in new technologies. Here in Britain we’ve taken some significant steps to help them.\n\nAt the UN in September, I increased by a half Britain’s funding for tackling global climate change. We will help poorer nations invest in things like solar energy and flood-resistant crops, which are vital to halting climate change, as well as helping them to adapt to the impact of climate change.\n\nAt the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting last month, I announced a package to support small island countries. We will help these countries to cut the cost of insuring themselves against the impact of climate-related natural catastrophes, and use their maritime resources to stimulate growth in a sustainable way. This is only possible because we have kept our promise to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid.\n\nOver the last couple of months I have hosted state visits from China’s President Xi Jinping and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi – countries which will be vital to driving down global warming, a subject which featured heavily in both visits.\n\nA month ago tomorrow, Paris was the victim of the deadliest terror attack in Europe for more than a decade. Today, it has played host to one of the most positive global steps in history. In striking this deal, the nations of the world have shown what unity, ambition and perseverance can do. We’ve secured our planet for many, many generations to come – and there is nothing more important than that.","2015-12-12 18:46:55+00","653092548048400_1093255924032058",1],[114,"I was in Carlisle today to see first-hand the work that's being done to help people affected by the terrible floods:","2015-12-07 19:19:17+00","653092548048400_1090991697591814",1],[115,"Watch this film to see how the Conservatives are delivering on the things that matter most to you and your family:","2015-12-07 14:49:20+00","653092548048400_1090880714269579",1],[118,"The army has been mobilised to help those affected by Storm Desmond and floods.

I have always said that we would do whatever was necessary, whatever it took, to track down Emwazi and stop him taking the lives of others.\n\nWe have been working, with the United States, literally around the clock to track him down. This was a combined effort. And the contribution of both our countries was essential.\n\nEmwazi is a barbaric murderer. He was shown in those sickening videos of the beheadings of British aid workers. He posed an ongoing and serious threat to innocent civilians not only in Syria, but around the world, and in the United Kingdom too.\n\nHe was ISIL’s lead executioner, and let us never forget that he killed many, many, Muslims too. And he was intent on murdering many more people.\n\nSo this was an act of self-defence.

Britain and her allies will not rest until we have defeated this evil terrorist death cult, and the poisonous ideology on which it feeds.\n\nToday though, my thoughts, and the thoughts of our country, are with the families of those who were so brutally murdered.\n\nJapanese citizens Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley and aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig.\n\nAnd of course our own citizens.

Such racism in 21st-century Britain, I said, was a disgrace, and I committed our party to ending discrimination and finishing the fight for real equality. The audience rose to their feet. It was a significant moment. And it provoked three reactions.\n\nThe first was: “What on earth are the Tories doing speaking about equality? It’s not their issue.” To this I say “nonsense”. We’re not just the party of the first Jewish prime minister and the first female prime minister; we’re the party that introduced the Disability Discrimination Act, legalised gay marriage and reduced stop-and-search, and that today will start forcing companies to publish the gap between men and women’s pay, and making police record Islamophobia as a separate hate crime.\n\nI accept that we haven’t always got this 100% right. No party ever has. And, because of our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome, for too long we have thought the only barrier to success was a lack of a decent education. Of course, that’s the most important thing – and it’s why school reform has been at the heart of our plan in government.\n\nBut we need to sweep away the other things holding people back, not least discrimination. You can give someone all the opportunities in the world – a brilliant school, first-class training, decent jobs – but it’s no good if they’re prevented from getting on because of their gender, race, religion, sexuality or disability. Getting this right is a natural and logical next step for a modern, compassionate Conservative party that wants to extend social mobility.\n\nThe second reaction was: “All right then, the Tories get this, but the only thing you can do is pass laws, and where are your proposals?” Of course, laws are important, like ours on disability discrimination and equal marriage. And we should recognise that the Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1976, or the Equal Pay Act from 1970 didn’t just outlaw discrimination, they also helped to change attitudes and shift public opinion.\n\nBut for all the legislation we have passed, discrimination still persists. It’s no longer signs on doors that say “no blacks allowed”; it’s quieter and more subtle discrimination. It’s the disappointment of not getting your first choice of university place; it’s being passed over for promotion and not knowing why; it’s organisations that recruit in their own image and aren’t confident enough to do something different, like employing a disabled person or a young black man or woman. In my opinion, you won’t change these attitudes simply through more laws, but in smarter, more innovative ways.\n\nThe third reaction was: “Right, if you mean this, when and how will you show us how?” We have managed to get some of the biggest graduate employers to pledge to anonymise their job applications – in other words, make them name-blind. That means those assessing applications will not be able to see the person’s name, so the ethnic or religious background it might imply cannot influence their prospects.\n\nThe civil service, BBC, NHS, local government, HSBC, Deloitte, KPMG, Virgin Money, learndirect – all these and more will now recruit people solely on merit. The Conservative party HQ will do it too. Taken together, these organisations employ 1.8 million people.\n\nAnd we’ll go further. Some research has shown that top universities make offers to 55% of white applicants, but only to 23% of black ones. The reasons are complex, but unconscious bias is clearly a risk. So we have agreed with UCAS that it will make its applications name-blind, too, from 2017.\n\nBritain has come so far, but the long march to an equal society isn’t over.

And one of the biggest social problems we face is extremism.\n\nSubversive, well-organised and sophisticated in their methods, Islamist extremists don’t just threaten our security, they jeopardise all that we’ve built together – our successful multi-racial, multi-faith democracy. So we have to confront them wherever we find them.\n\nThat’s why, today, we publish our Counter-Extremism Strategy. It sets out our plan to tackle this poison on every level: to counter the ideology that underpins it; to take on both the violent and non-violent parts of the creed; to empower the mainstream voices that are too often drowned out; and to tackle the alienation and segregation that can allow extremist narratives to take root.\n\nAs we do all this, we should remember these vital insights. One: this is a generational battle; perhaps the defining one of this century. Defeating our enemies will take time, patience and require us constantly to adapt.\n\nTwo: this is, at its heart, a battle of ideas. On one side sit the extremists, with a deliberate strategy to infect public debate, divide our communities and advance their warped worldview.\nOn the other side must sit everyone else – not just the institutions of the state, such as the government, police and security services; but community groups and the rest of society. The extremist narrative needs to be fought every day at the kitchen table, on the university campus, online and on the airwaves. \n\nIn the end, this battle will only be won through argument and persuasion – people taking a stand to demonstrate the incredible power of our liberal, democratic values, and the emptiness of theirs.\n\nFor those who have been sucked furthest into the extremist worldview, our strategy also includes new proposals for intensive – and mandatory – de-radicalisation programmes. That means attendance at programmes can be made a condition of a licence for terrorist offenders after their release from prison, or part of a court order against a suspected terrorist – including those returning from Syria.\n\nThree: while Islamist extremists in no way represent the true spirit of Islam, we cannot ignore the fact that they attempt to justify their views and actions through Islamic scripture and theology. \n\nGlobally, it is a challenge for all of Islam that a perverted, illiberal and hostile interpretation of this great religion has been allowed to grow. It is a problem that so many see the West as an oppressor, and buy into the grievances, if not necessarily the violence. And it is a worry for the world that some feel allegiance only to a religious brotherhood, instead of to their fellow citizens in nation states.\n\nSo in response, we need to support Muslims who are confronting the extremist narrative and providing a positive alternative. There are already so many. Last week I convened the first meeting of my Community Engagement Forum – many of them Muslims angry at the hijacking of their faith, eager to take a stand.\n\nI know we have got to back these people wholeheartedly. So we will offer all the protection, funding, practical help and support we possibly can. That’s why, as part of our strategy, we will provide a further £5 million this year to community groups so they reach even more young people.\n\nBut we need more – far more – people to come forward. As a government, I know we must own this problem. But our Muslim communities must own it, too. We have all got a critical part to play, but I strongly feel the currently silent majority can make all the difference.\n\nThey’re central to standing up and challenging the warped interpretation of theology and scripture. They’re central to putting forward a liberal, tolerant and inclusive Islam, and demonstrating how it can work in harmony with democracy, freedom and equality.\n\nThey can show the boy in East London or the girl in Birmingham how proud you can feel to be both British and Muslim, without conflict or contradiction. And in standing up, by speaking out, I am confident that we will defeat the extremists, and together build the Greater Britain that is within our grasp.","2015-10-19 07:05:34+00","653092548048400_1067675516590099",1],[160,"Today's employment rate is the highest since records began.

It is, of course, typical of her selfless sense of service that she would have us treat this day just like any other.\n\nBut while I rarely advocate disobeying Her Majesty, I do think it is right that today we should stop and take a moment as a nation to mark this historic milestone - and to thank Her Majesty for the extraordinary service she has given to our country over more than six decades. \n\nHer Majesty the Queen inspires us all with her incredible service, her dignified leadership and the extraordinary grace with which she carries out her duties. \n\nOn her 21st birthday, in a radio broadcast from Cape Town, over four years before she would accede to the throne, the then Princess dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth saying: “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.”\n\nIt is one thing for a 21 year old to utter those inspiring words. It is another to live by them for more than 60 years.\n\nIt is truly humbling to comprehend the scale of service that Her Majesty has given to this country.\n\nThe reign of Queen Elizabeth II has been a golden thread running through three post-war generations. And she has presided over more than two-thirds of our history as a full democracy.\n\nWhen I was born, Her Majesty had already been reigning for fourteen years.\n\nIn 63 years and 216 days she has worked with 12 Prime Ministers, 6 Archbishops of Canterbury and 9 Cabinet Secretaries. \n\nShe has answered 3.5 million pieces of correspondence, sent over 100,000 telegrams to Centenarians across the Commonwealth and met more people than any other Monarch in history.\n\nAnd yet, whether it is something we suspect she enjoys, such as the Highland Games, or something we suspect she might be less keen on, such as spending New Year’s Eve in the Millennium Dome, she never, ever falters.\n\nHer selfless sense of service and duty have earned her unparalleled respect and admiration, not only in Britain, but all around the world.\n\nTurning to her leadership, Her Majesty exemplifies the unique combination of tradition and progress that has come to define us as a nation.\n\nShe has been a rock of stability in an era in which our country has changed so much, providing an enduring focal point for all her people.\n\nBut she has also recognised the need to embrace change. \n\nAs she said in an address to both Houses of Parliament back on her Golden Jubilee in 2002: “For if a Jubilee becomes a moment to define an age, then for me we must speak of change...Change has become a constant; managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future.”\n\nHer Majesty’s contribution to shaping the future of the Commonwealth has been particularly extraordinary. Some doubted whether this organisation would succeed. But she has assiduously supported it, growing it from just 7 members in 1952 to 53 today - and building a unique family of nations that spans every continent, all the main religions and nearly a third of the world’s population.\n\nAs a diplomat and an ambassador for Britain, it is hard to overstate what she has done for our country, representing us on 265 official visits to 116 different countries, including 22 visits to Canada alone.\n\nAnd from her post-Apartheid visit to South Africa, to her State visit to Ireland, we have seen time and again how the presence and judicious words of Her Majesty can build partnership and progress like no other. \n\nShe is held in deep affection by leaders around the world. Even ardent republicans fall under her spell.\n\nAs we commemorate this historic milestone, I know that Her Majesty would want us to pay a particular tribute to the service and support of her whole family, not least the Duke of Edinburgh who has stood by her side every day of her reign.\n\nThroughout her long service, the Queen has carried herself with an extraordinary grace and presence.\n\nShe has led a gentle evolution of the monarchy, bringing it closer to the people while maintaining its dignity.  \n\nShe pioneered the first televised Christmas Day Message, she opened up the Royal Collection and Palaces, and she invented the Royal Walkabout, so that she could meet more people on her visits.\n\nPeople who meet the Queen often talk about it for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd I am sure that I speak for all of my eleven predecessors, when I say that that going to see the Queen to form a government, and then meeting her once a week, is one of the most enjoyable, inspiring and humbling honours of this office. \n\nWhen I joined Her Majesty for her State visit to Germany earlier this year, I learnt that there are many female sovereigns that the Germans call “die Königin” - but there is only one they call “die Queen”. \n\nIn fact the German dictionary – the Duden - provides as its example sentence, “The Queen is coming on a State Visit to Berlin” - and then offers one key grammatical prescript: there is no plural.\n\nThe Queen is our Queen. And we could not be more proud of her.\n\nShe has served this country with unerring grace, dignity and decency.\n\nAnd long may she continue to do so.","2015-09-09 11:47:09+00","653092548048400_1048576275166690",1],[184,"52 new free schools are opening their doors this week - and I'm committed to helping another 500 open over the next five years.\n\nPlease watch my video from Corby Technical College about the Conservatives' plans to create more good and outstanding school places.","2015-09-02 19:44:49+00","653092548048400_1044461558911495",1],[175,"Earlier this month I was in Lebanon and Jordan, meeting the people who have fled war and terror in Syria and Iraq.\n \nThere I met Malik, aged 15, who lost his leg to a barrel bomb - just one of the millions of victims maimed, murdered, driven from their homes and separated from their families by the brutality of Assad and ISIL.\n \nI know British Muslims will be thinking of people like Malik as you come together with loved ones this Eid, to pray, reflect, feast and exchange gifts.\n \nAs the faith group in this country that gives more than any other, I know you will take pride in the fact that Britain is the second-largest contributor to the Syrian refugee crisis.\n \nOver a billion pounds of British aid – our largest contribution to a humanitarian crisis in history – is helping people like Malik and stopping others from making the perilous attempts at reaching Europe with the malign hand of the traffickers.\n \nBut British Muslims are known for more than their generosity.\n \nThey’re known for rising to the top of their fields, from business to medicine, from sport to politics – including the government I am so proud to lead.\n \nThis is the great British story: a multi-racial, multi-faith democracy built over generations, where people can come with nothing rise as high as their talent allows.\n \nSo as families and friends come together this Eid, let us celebrate those achievements, and let us reflect on those who are suffering during this holy festival.\n \nI wish you a joyous and peaceful festival.\n \nEid Mubarak.","2015-09-23 19:50:47+00","653092548048400_1056499811041003",1],[177,"Well done to Leon Smith, Andy Murray and the team on winning #GBRAUS and reaching the first Davis Cup final in 37 years.","2015-09-20 15:58:47+00","653092548048400_1054954757862175",1],[179,"I'm at a refugee camp in Lebanon, hearing some heartbreaking stories.

At the heart of our election manifesto was that simple goal: to give people security at every stage of their lives.\n\nSecurity is formed of many things: having a decent home; knowing that you can afford childcare; getting the training you need to secure a worthwhile career; earning enough not just to get through the month, but to get on in life. The economic progress we’ve made in recent years has been essential in delivering on this agenda. We’ve taken 3.8 million people out of income tax, trained more than two million apprentices and begun the vital work of building more homes and enabling more people to buy them.\n\nWith our growing economy we can now do more. That’s why we are able to double free childcare for three and four-year-olds, roll out Help to Buy and build 200,000 discounted starter homes. These policies are built on economic success. Without the hard work of recent years we simply wouldn’t be able to afford them.\n\nThe most important source of security is a well-paid job. But those jobs cannot be guaranteed by repairing the economy alone. They take reforms, too — like capping welfare, which we’ve reduced to £20,000 a year; like boosting businesses, whose taxes we’ve cut; like boosting apprenticeships and expanding our universities, which now have no cap on the number of places they can offer. It’s working. We’ve hit record levels of employment. It’s that combination of recovery and reform that will enable us to help those who often have the least security: the lowest paid.\n\nThe national living wage will be introduced in April, giving low-paid workers a £20 a week pay rise. By the end of the decade, it will reach at least £9 an hour. Combine that with an increase in the personal allowance to £12,500 and you can see the power of the modern Conservative party’s One Nation message. We back work. We promote well-paid work. We want you to keep more of your own money. That’s why we can say: we are the true party of working people in Britain today.\n\nBut the national living wage will only work if it is properly enforced. Businesses are responsible for making that happen, and today I’m announcing how we will make sure they do. We’ve already doubled the fines for non-payment of the national minimum wage — and we will double them again for that and the national living wage.\n\nWe will significantly increase the enforcement budget, set up a new team in HMRC to take forward criminal prosecutions for those who deliberately don’t comply and, from this autumn, ensure that anyone found guilty will be considered for disqualification from being a company director for 15 years. All that will be overseen by a new labour market enforcement director. So, to unscrupulous employers who think that they can get labour on the cheap, the message is clear: underpay your staff and you will pay the price.\n\nBy making sure that working people properly benefit from the recovery, we are winning the argument for pro-business, pro-enterprise economics. That argument has to be won by every political generation. Those of us who fought socialism in the 1980s and perhaps thought that the “red in tooth and claw” variety was dead were clearly wrong.\n\nLook at today’s Labour leadership candidates. All of them are in a race to the left, vowing to borrow, tax and spend more — all the things that failed in the last century and were rejected at the last election. Listening to some of the anti-Nato, anti-American, profoundly anti-business and anti-enterprise debates is like Groundhog Day. Labour aren’t learning. They’re slaves to a failed dogma that has always left working people paying the price. One of their most disturbing tendencies is their obedience to left-wing union leaders — the people who are behind the Tube strikes that have wreaked chaos in the capital this summer.\n\nWe are changing the law so that strikes can go ahead for essential services only with a 50 per cent turnout and 40 per cent support. We are condemning walkouts that are not the absolute last resort.\n\nThis contrast between Labour support for disruptive strikes and our action to help people get on drives home the point: which is the true party of working people?\n\nLabour, who support the unions of well-paid Tube drivers and even-better-paid union bosses? Or us, the Conservatives — the ones who are on the side of the student who just wants to get to college, the nurse who just wants to get to work, the shopkeeper who just wants to get some customers through her door?\n\nOur autumn agenda is about keeping our foot to the floor on the recovery. If we do that, we can turn a low-pay, high-tax, high-welfare society into one with higher pay, lower taxes and less reliance on welfare — restoring the link between hard work and reward. That is what will help people across our country. And that is what my One Nation mission is all about.","2015-09-01 07:29:23+00","653092548048400_1043708238986827",1],[189,"The 4.2% growth in retail sales in July is more proof our long-term plan is working, meaning more jobs and more opportunities for people.","2015-08-20 10:51:06+00","653092548048400_1037655332925451",1],[191,"Delighted Seb Coe has been elected the new president of the IAAF - an outstanding athlete who delivered the brilliant London 2012 Olympics.","2015-08-19 06:54:41+00","653092548048400_1037110596313258",1],[192,"It's good news that inflation remains low.

One nation, one United Kingdom. It is that brand of modern, compassionate conservatism that has guided us since May 8 - and it will continue to guide this Government for the rest of this Parliament.\n\nOur central task is to finish turning around our economy. Through our Long Term Economic Plan we are getting the fundamentals right, generating growth, creating jobs, clearing the deficit and offering the British people the security they need to get on in their lives. I am determined that we will build on this foundation. Just as Conservative ideas have won the debate on how to manage the economy, so I believe Conservative ideas can now shape the future in meeting the challenges facing our whole society too.\n\nOn the challenge of delivering an economy that supports working people, it is Conservatives who believe that a free enterprise economy is an ally not an enemy in generating wealth and extending opportunity. By cutting taxes, reforming welfare and increasing minimum wages we are showing we are the real party of working people.\n\nOn tackling poverty, it is Conservative ideas that can make the biggest difference - attacking the causes of poverty, not just the symptoms, by tackling generational unemployment, strengthening families and ensuring that work always pays.\n\nOn delivering security in a dangerous world, we will confront the extremist threat in all its forms and build a stronger, prouder sense of British identity.\n\nAs Conservatives we will also meet our commitments on defence spending and international aid. This is not some naïve neo-conservative internationalism but a hard-headed realism that recognises our prosperity and security are inextricably linked to how we meet the threats of terrorism, poverty and climate change.\n\nOur success also depends on being an outward-facing trading nation and so I will continue leading trade delegations oversees to win new business for Britain.\n\nTaken together all these beliefs add up to a genuine One Nation vision for our country through which I believe Conservative ideas can lead the way for a decade.\n\nYet during the election there were some who suggested we would only be firmly on the side of working people or demonstrate true compassion with the Liberal Democrats holding our hands. These first hundred days have shown this is simply not true. Indeed without the restrictions of coalition we have shown that by being bolder and more radical we can be more progressive and compassionate.\n\nWe are delivering strong, centre-ground, pragmatic and progressive government exemplified by our new National Living Wage and our commitment to a real terms increase of at least £8 billion a year by 2020 to support the NHS’s own Five Year Plan. We are moving from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. By 2020, the new National Living Wage will represent a pay rise of around £100 a week for the lowest paid. While our continued commitment to cutting taxes means we have already raised again the amount you can earn before paying any income tax at all. And the legislation we are bringing forward will mean no increases in income tax, VAT or national insurance in the lifetime of this parliament.\n\nWe are supporting working parents with the challenges of childcare, so they can take on that extra shift or go back to work after a break. So the Queen’s Speech honoured our promise to double free childcare to 30 hours a week for three and four year olds.\n\nWe are also seeing through vital reforms in our public services, including the creation of a truly 7-day NHS. At a time when Labour is giving up on public service reform and appealing to its left-wing base, I believe it is a moment for a Conservative government to be bolder still.\n\nThere is no better example than academy schools. We want everyone to have a chance to succeed and education is the best way of ensuring that. This means schools with strong standards and discipline. It also means giving great headteachers the freedom to run their own schools with the ability to set their own curriculum and pay their staff properly. Academy schools were created to do exactly that. This is something Labour used to understand and we have proudly expanded them, including the creation of entirely new academies as free schools.\n\nI profoundly believe this is the right direction for our country because I want teachers not bureaucrats deciding how best to educate our children. We have already seen how academy freedoms have been fundamental in turning around failing schools – like Manchester Enterprise Academy, where results have almost doubled during its time as an academy.\n\nThat is why in the first 100 days we have brought forward legislation to transform all failing schools into academies and for the first time taken the power to convert coasting schools into academies too. But we have also seen how these freedoms can help all schools, with more than 3,000 good and outstanding schools already making the decision to become academies themselves.\n\nSo when Labour leadership contenders say they want to phase out academies, I say the opposite. I want every school in the country to have the opportunity to become an academy and to benefit from the freedoms this brings. So we will make it a priority to recruit more academy sponsors and support more great headteachers in coming together in academy chains. In doing so, we can extend educational excellence and opportunity to every school and every child in our country.\n\n100 days in, we are showing it is a Conservative majority government which has the ideas to build the One Nation vision and to deliver real social mobility in our country. We will not waste a second in getting on with the job and delivering the prosperity and security on which our future depends.","2015-08-15 08:32:53+00","653092548048400_1034997286524589",1],[196,"I have just spoken to François Hollande about Calais.

My speech today at Royal Air Force Coningsby:\n\nThank you very much for that welcome, and it’s a huge honour to be here as Prime Minister, as someone who has to think about all those operations that you go on and all the things we ask you to do.  It’s a real honour for me to come here today and say a very big thank you for all that you do .  And that was the first thing: a thank you, not just to the RAF, but a thank you to all our armed services for the work that you do.  Right now, we are flying air policing missions over the Baltic, we are picking people out of the Mediterranean Sea, we’re training troops in Afghanistan, we’re helping the armed forces of the Ukraine, we’re defeating Ebola in West Africa; there are so many things that our armed forces are doing on our behalf, and it really does give me huge pleasure to come here today and say a very big thank you.\n \nIt also gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to the skills and the courage and the bravery and the professionalism that you all have, and it’s a particularly good moment to do that as you all did so much over the weekend to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.  I think the whole country felt a huge sense of pride and ownership when those Spitfires, accompanied by the Typhoon, beautifully dressed up in Battle of Britain livery, flew over our capital city.  And it’s a reminder of what that was all about.  It was all about huge courage and professionalism.  It was all about recognising that, without strong defences, you have nothing as a country.  And it was all about also recognising that modern technology, in this case, the Spitfire, was absolutely key to saving our whole country.\n \nAnd that leads me to the third and final thing I want to say.  Because when it came – comes to that extraordinary courage at the Battle of Britain, what the few did was actually save the British way of life, and those lessons we learned then need to be applied now.  And that leads me to the third thing I want to say, which is about the future.  I think we need to recognise just what a dangerous and insecure and difficult world we’re living in, and that means it’s absolutely essential that we invest in the future of our defences.  Now, for the last five years, we’ve maintained the fifth-largest defence budget anywhere in the world, the second-biggest defence budget in NATO after the Americans, a budget of over £30 billion a year that gives us huge capabilities.  \n \nBut I’m absolutely clear we need to do more, and that’s what the Chancellor was talking about in the Budget.  And it wasn’t just talk; it was real money.  Not saying we’re just going to maintain the defence budget where it is, not saying we’re just going to keep up with inflation in terms of the defence budget, but we’re going to increase what we spend on defence between now and 2020 in real terms, over and above inflation, by the equivalent of as much as £6 billion extra.  I think that’s a really important vote of confidence in all our armed services, in the defence of our nation, and making sure that we have the capabilities necessary to keep us safe.\n \nNow, when it comes to how we spend that money, how we invest that money in the future of our defences, of course it’s right we have a Strategic Defence and Security Review, that we look at all the threats that we face, the threat of what is happening on the continent of Europe with Ukraine, the threats we face from cyberspace, the threats that we face with unstable and broken states in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.  But I would highlight one particular threat, which I think is such a threat to our country, to our way of life, and to peace and stability in our own country, and that is the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism.  We live in a world where young people, including people in our own country, are giving up the chance of a great life, of a great school, of a loving family, travelling halfway round the world to go and train as terrorists in the Middle East.  \n \nNow, of course, there are so many things that we can do to stop this.  We can confiscate people’s passports.  We can keep out the preachers of hate.  We can try to build a stronger, a more integrated country.  We can warn about the dangers of extremism.  We can do all of these things.  But in the end, we need to do something else as well, and that is to make sure that Britain, with her allies, can destroy the fanatical ISIL extremist state in Iraq and Syria.  We’ve done a huge amount already, and I want to thank the brave RAF crews who’ve flown so many missions over Iraq, more than any other country apart from the United States.  But I’m quite clear that, when it comes to the threats our country faces, this threat of extremist Islamist terrorism, a threat on our own streets and on our own people, as we saw tragically on that beach in Tunisia, this is the threat of our generation, the battle of our generation, the fight that we’re going to have, and I’m absolutely determined that the RAF, the Army, the Navy, will have the equipment, the means and the resources to deal with it.\n \nOne of the things that will mean is making sure that we have the drones, the spy planes, the special forces, the unique capabilities that make sure we can deal with this threat at its source.  All of you will play a huge role in this, and it gives me huge pleasure and a great honour to come here and thank you personally for all the work that you do.  Britain’s armed forces are an incredible example to our country.  The values you display, values of teamwork, values of loyalty, values of service, values of courage: these are British values and they’re values we all need more of.  So thank you for what you do.  Thank you for the celebration that you’ve given us over the last weekend with the Battle of Britain flight.  But above all, thank you for what you’re going to do with the extra resources that, quite rightly, the taxpayer will be putting in to defending our nation, defending our way of life, defeating Islamist extremist terror and standing up for Britain and British values all over the world.  Thank you.","2015-07-13 18:24:50+00","653092548048400_1018861878138130",1],[210,"The introduction of a National Living Wage is an important step as we move to a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare society. #SummerBudget","2015-07-08 18:39:19+00","653092548048400_1016563601701291",1],[212,"I have just met the Chief of the Defence Staff to explain how we'll protect defence spending going forward.  #SummerBudget","2015-07-08 17:37:58+00","653092548048400_1016542501703401",1],[213,"","2015-07-08 10:26:44+00","653092548048400_1016383641719287",1],[215,"At 11.30am today, the country comes together to remember the victims of one of the deadliest terrorist atrocities on mainland Britain.\n \nTen years on from the 7/7 London attacks, the threat from terrorism continues to be as real as it is deadly – the murder of 30 innocent Britons whilst holidaying in Tunisia is a brutal reminder of that fact.

But we need to understand the extremist threat we face, and why we must face it.\n \nIslamist extremism is an extreme ideology that seeks to destroy nation-states and invent its own barbaric realm. It often uses violence, mostly against Muslims. But it also promotes ideas hostile to our values of democracy, freedom and sexual equality, and promotes discrimination, sectarianism and segregation.\n \nTo tackle this, we need to understand why this ideology is proving so attractive. I argue that it is for four reasons. This ideology is not just subversive, but can seem exciting. It has often sucked people in from non-violence to violence. It is overpowering moderate voices within the debate. And it can gain traction because of issues of identity and failures of integration.\n \nThe right approach for defeating extremism follows from answering each one of these four points. In the Autumn, we will publish our Counter-Extremism Strategy, setting out in detail what we will do to counter this threat. But today I set out the principles we will adopt.\n \nFirst, we need to confront the ideology and expose it as a belief system that glorifies violence and subjugates people. We need to de-glamorise the extremist cause, especially ISIL. So we will use people who really understand the true nature of life under ISIL to communicate what it is like. We will counter ideology better on the ground through specific de-radicalisation programmes - and go much further in prison and online. We will also do more to tackle appalling cultural practices like FGM, forced marriage, so-called honour based violence. We need everyone - Government, local authorities, police, schools, all of us - to enforce our values across the spectrum.\n \nSecond, we need to tackle both violent and non-violent extremism. That means tackling groups and organisations who may not advocate violence, but promote the extremist narrative. We do this already - that's why we ban hate preachers and have redirected public funds away from bodies that promote non-violent extremism.\n \nBut we will go further, for example in education with measures to guard against radicalisation of children in so-called supplementary schools or tuition centres. We will introduce new, targeted powers to deal with those who peddle hatred. This is not just about changing laws - it is about all of us changing our approach to challenge extremism, including universities. We need the support of families and communities, and the Government will help where it can. I know some parents are worried their children might turn to this ideology, even seeking to travel to Syria and Iraq. So we will introduce a new scheme to enable parents to apply directly to get their children's passports temporarily cancelled.\n \nThird, we need to embolden different voices within the Muslim community. We are now going to actively encourage the reforming and moderate Muslim voices. This extremist ideology is not true Islam, but the extremists self-identify as Muslims. Denying that disempowers critical reforming voices. These are voices that are challenging the fusion of religion and politics, the scriptural basis which extremists claim to be acting on - and can provide an alternative worldview that could stop a teenager's slide along the spectrum of extremism.\n \nSo we will back those who share our values with practical help, funding, campaigns, protection and political representation. I am going to set up a new community engagement forum so I can hear directly from those who are challenging extremism. I also want to challenge broadcasters - who are free to put whoever they want on the airwaves - to consider giving the huge number of Muslims who represent liberal values, run credible charities and community organisations, the platform they deserve, including MPs.\n \nFourth, we need to build a more cohesive society, so more people feel a part of it and are therefore less vulnerable to extremism. I understand that it can be hard being young and Muslim, or young and Sikh, or young and black in this country. I know that while injustice remains - be it with racism, discrimination or Islamophobia - you may feel there is no place for you in Britain. But there is a place for you, and I will do everything I can to support you. We have made progress in recent years, but we need to go further.\n \nWe need to lift the horizons of some of our most isolated and deprived communities. So Louise Casey will review how to boost opportunity and integration - and bring Britain together as One Nation. This means looking at ensuring people learn English, boosting employment - especially for women - and state agencies working with communities to properly promote integration. We also need to look at segregation, because when people grow up and go to school hardly ever coming into meaningful contact with people from other backgrounds - it drives people apart. So we will take a fresh look at the sort of shared future we want for our young people.\n \nThis is how I believe we can win the struggle of our generation: countering the extremist ideology by standing up for and promoting British values; taking on extremism in all its forms - both violent and non-violent; empowering those moderate and reforming voices who speak for the vast majority of Muslims that want to reclaim their religion; and addressing the identity crisis that some young people feel by bringing our communities together and extending opportunity to all.\n \nThis is not an issue for one community or part of society - but for all of us.

For those of us committed to that goal, there has been a recent slew of good news. Two months ago, we returned to a House of Commons in which the number of women MPs had risen by a third, and one third of those around the cabinet table are women. Last week the army appointed the highest-ranking woman in its history, Major General Susan Ridge. And this week we reveal that women now make up at least 25 per cent of all FTSE 100 company boards — a target set by government, a target met.\n\nThat’s a cause for celebration. But the job is not complete. The Commons is nearly a third female; it should be half. The armed forces need more women in all ranks. Boardrooms need more female members. As a result of our jobs revolution there are more women in work than ever before, but one problem persists: the difference between men and women’s pay.\n\nUnder the coalition government, the gender pay gap narrowed. For full-time workers under 40, it is almost zero. But overall, a woman still earns just 80p for every £1 earned by a man. That is a scandal — and I’m determined to close the gap. For me, this comes back to the type of government I want to run: a One Nation government, which brings our country together and helps everyone, whoever they are, get on in life. So here’s my plan.\n\nOne: transparency. We have already introduced equal pay audits for those companies that have lost employment tribunals. But today I’m announcing a really big move: we will make every single company with 250 employees or more publish the gap between average female earnings and average male earnings. That will cast sunlight on the discrepancies and create the pressure we need for change, driving women’s wages up.\n\nThis goes back to what we announced in the budget last week. Our aim is to fundamentally rebalance our economy — to transform Britain from a high-welfare, high-tax, low-pay economy into a lower-welfare, lower-tax, higher-pay society. Higher pay is something we want for everyone. That is why the chancellor announced the national living wage, which starts next April at £7.20 and will reach over £9 by 2020. This will primarily help women, who tend to be in lower-paid jobs. It will help close the gender pay gap. But we need to go further, and that’s why introducing gender pay audits is so important. It’s part of a new British contract: we give businesses the lowest corporation tax in the G20, increase their national insurance allowance and cut their regulations; in return, they pay their staff properly, and fairly.\n\nTwo: we must widen girls’ horizons. It’s great that, for instance, nearly half of our medics, biological scientists and chemists are women. But just 7 per cent of engineers are female. Women are just a fifth of IT technicians. There’s only one female Supreme Court judge. We need to show schoolgirls that there are no no-go professions. That’s why our new careers service puts businesses at the helm and why we are campaigning to drive up the number of girls doing science, tech, engineering and manufacturing. It’s working: since 2010, girls doing maths A level is up by 8 per cent and those doing physics is up by 15 per cent.\n\nThree: we must help more women to reach the top. While they are 47 per cent of the workforce, women are just 34 per cent of managers, directors and senior officials. Today I’m speaking at the Times CEO summit. Those bosses have shown that, without legislation and without arbitrary quotas, you can bring about change. In just five years, women on FTSE 100 boards have increased from 12.5 per cent to a quarter. I’ll be congratulating those CEOs and asking them to keep up the momentum.\n\nFour: we need to address childcare. The pay gap flows from the fact that, when women have children, many cannot afford to go back to work full time — or even at all. That then prevents them from moving up through the ranks. That’s why affordable childcare is the centrepiece of this One Nation government. One of the first things we’ve done is legislate for 30 hours of free childcare for all three and four- year-olds, doubling the existing allowance. And we are making childcare tax-free, too, worth up to £2,000 per year for every child.\n\nTransparency, skills, representation, affordable childcare — these things can end the gender pay gap in a generation. That’s my goal. In past centuries, the Brontë sisters published their novels under men’s names; Marie Curie released her research as her husband; Ada Lovelace made great leaps as the first computer programmer but watched her male colleague get the credit. Then came the First World War. Women more than proved their mettle in the world of work. The vote came in 1918. Nancy Astor was the first female MP to take her seat. The first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, transformed the country. That happened in just a few decades. So just think what we can do over the next generation.\n\nWhen my daughters, Nancy and Florence, start work, I want them to look back at the gender pay gap in the same way we look back at women not voting and not working — as something outdated and wrong that we overcame, together.","2015-07-14 07:11:34+00","653092548048400_1019065314784453",1],[209,"Our charities undertake vital work, bringing communities together and providing support to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\nBut the conduct of some fundraisers used by them is frankly unacceptable and damages the reputation of the sector as a whole, which is why we’re introducing a new law to make sure charities raise funds in the right sort of way.","2015-07-11 10:25:19+00","653092548048400_1017744394916545",1],[211,"It was great to meet the England #Lionesses - who played so well in the World Cup.","2015-07-09 13:12:46+00","653092548048400_1016888371668814",1],[214,"My best wishes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Princess Charlotte's Christening today.","2015-07-05 12:16:54+00","653092548048400_1014975065193478",1],[217,"At a time of uncertainty abroad, here at home we will be delivering a budget next week with economic stability at its heart, offering security for working people.\n\nEncouraging home ownership is central to that. Having your own place is an important stake in our economy. It’s also one of the best expressions of the aspirational country we want to build, where hard work is rewarded.\n\nIt’s also about social justice. We don’t want this to be a country where if you’re rich you can buy a home, but if you’re less well off you can’t. We want it to be One Nation, where whoever you are, you can get on in life.\n\nIn the past five years, we got builders building, lenders lending, and government-backed schemes alone helped more than 200,000 people on to the property ladder.\n\nThe next five will be about going much further. We will help people to reach their dreams by keeping Help to Buy until 2020 and extending the Right to Buy to 1.3 million housing association tenants. They will get a discount of up to 70 per cent to buy their own home, and we will open a register of interest so that thousands can sign up in the first year.\n\nAnd once you’ve got your home, you’ll be able to pass it on. As we promised in our manifesto, we’ll take the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the richest — and it’s a promise we will keep. As we said we would, we’ll pay for this reform by limiting the pension tax relief to those who are earning more than £150,000. It can only be right that when you’ve worked hard to own your own home, it will go to your family and not the taxman.\n\nWe will also boost supply. We will build 200,000 starter homes by 2020, sold at below market rate and for first-time buyers under the age of 40. To deliver on this commitment, we will ensure every reasonably sized housing site includes a proportion of these homes for young people.\n\nWe will also say to local councils: you must give land with planning permission to people who want to build or commission their own homes. Custom-built homes account for 60 per cent of all of Germany’s new housing stock, and our plans will double the number in our country. We will also undertake a massive programme of regeneration around our train stations, as part of a wider drive to release public sector land for 150,000 homes.\n\nWe will also make the planning system more effective. We will set out more detail next week, as part of our productivity plan. It is unacceptable, for example, that many councils are still not close to having a plan for delivering the homes their communities need. We will take action, in consultation with local communities, to deliver the plans for those areas which have failed to do so.\n\nOf course, there will be opponents of much of the above. We are determined to take them on.\n\nFirst, the opponents of Right to Buy. There are those who think it’s unfair on private renters, who don’t get these discounts. But we’re offering them help through schemes such as shared ownership and Help to Buy. Let’s now help others, some of whom are the least well-off in our country. We’re proud that it’s the Conservatives who are giving them some hope, and if anyone wants to argue with us on that, we say bring it on.\n\nThen there are those who oppose Right to Buy because they think it won’t work, and will reduce housing stock. But the system right now doesn’t work. One of the main ways to encourage housing associations to build more homes is to increase their revenue. That means increasing social rents. And that means increasing housing benefit — which comes from either taxing or borrowing more. This is another of the Labour-inspired merry-go-rounds we need to get off. Housing benefit already costs us £24 billion a year, two thirds of what we spend on defence. That figure needs to come down. And despite housing benefit revenue doubling in the past 13 years, some housing associations aren’t building enough homes — indeed, some aren’t building at all.\n\nWe have a better model. By helping people to own their own home, through Right to Buy, we can turn tenants into homeowners and reduce housing benefit bills. And by selling off the most expensive council houses when they become vacant we can replace every home we sell — whether an expensive council house or one through Right to Buy. And we will do so quicker than the current three-year rule requires.\n\nSo we will transform Britain: from a lower-home-ownership, higher-tax, higher-housing-benefit country to one that encourages home ownership, reduces taxes, lowers housing benefit bills and builds more homes.\n\nSecond, there will be the opponents of planning reform. We will always protect the green belt and make sure planning decisions are made by local people.\n\nBut the fact is that just 10 per cent of England is developed. There is capacity for 400,000 homes on brownfield land — we need to get building. And as we do, we will make sure the homes look good. We have already given local people the power to create neighbourhood plans; more than 1,000 are well under way. This gives local people an even greater ability to decide where new homes go and what they look like. And we will go further in the coming months.\n\nBut that all requires planning reform. It’s simple: you are either pro-reform, or not; for building homes, or not; on the side of young people, or not. We know our position. As a One Nation government, we will always be squarely on the side of those who want to get on.","2015-07-04 09:38:20+00","653092548048400_1014450811912570",1],[220,"It's good news that the economy grew even more strongly than we thought.

As the names and identities of the victims in Tunisia emerge – and the horror of what they faced becomes clear – those feelings grow. Everyone is asking the same thing: how can a day at the beach for families and friends have turned into a scene of such horror?\n\nThe man who did this, the smiling gunman with a Kalashnikov hidden in a parasol, demonstrates the level of evil we are dealing with. It’s an evil we’ve seen on Mount Sinjar in Iraq and in shopping malls in Kenya; at magazine offices in Paris and in schools in Pakistan.\n\nOn the same day as the holidaymakers in Tunisia came under attack, workers near Lyon and worshippers in Kuwait fell victim to this evil, as did over 100 Syrians, who were executed in their homes in Kobane by ISIL.\n\nBut we will not be cowed. To our shock and grief we must add another word: resolve. Unshakeable resolve. We will stand up for our way of life. So ours must be a full-spectrum response – a response at home and abroad; in the immediate aftermath and far into the future.\n\nThe first thing we must do is everything we can to help the victims of this attack. Our consular crisis centre has been running 24/7. We now have a team of over 50 consular staff, police officers and experts from the Red Cross on the ground in Sousse.\n\nHundreds of police officers are now working on this operation both in Tunisia and here at home – providing vital support to families; helping the Tunisians to identify those that were murdered; and launching an investigation into what happened.\n\nWe are doing everything necessary to get people home and to help the injured, including sending a team of military medical liaison officers out to Sousse to assist with medevac as required.\n\nAnd in the coming days we will do all we can to bring home those who lost their lives as quickly as possible. I have been speaking to President Essebsi to thank the Tunisian authorities for their assistance, and we’ve been discussing what more we can do.\n\nAcross the world, we must do more to work together and build our capacity to deal with terrorism. ISIL may use ancient barbarism in its methods of killing, but it is modern in its propaganda techniques, using social media as its primary weapon.\n\nThat is why we must give our police and security services the tools they need to root out this poison. And we must look at how we can work with countries like Tunisia to counter this online propaganda.\n\nWe must also deal with it at its source, in places like Syria, Iraq and Libya, from where ISIL is peddling and plotting its death cult. That means supporting governments to strengthen weak political institutions and tackle political instability. \n\nThese ungoverned spaces are the areas in which the terrorist groups thrive. British aircraft are already delivering the second largest number of airstrikes over Iraq, where ISIL has taken hold.\n\nOur airborne intelligence and surveillance assets are assisting other countries with their operations over Syria. And we are working with the UN, our EU and US partners to support the formation of a Government of National Accord in Libya. And we will continue to work with our partners in the region.\n\nThe third thing, perhaps the most important thing, is confronting the poisonous ideology that is driving terrible actions like those we saw on Friday.\n\nThat ideology stems from an extremist narrative, which hijacks the religion of Islam. It says that the West is bad and freedom is wrong. It says that women are inferior and homosexuality is evil. It tells people that religious rule trumps the rule of law, that Caliphate trumps nation state.\n\nTo defeat this poisonous ideology, we must be clear about why it is so wrong. We must expose and defeat what it is that persuades young people, from Tunisia to Kuwait, from Belgium to Britain, to join ISIL.\n\nWhen the gunman attacked innocent people spending time with their families on the beach, he was attacking the very things we stand for.\n\nWe must be stronger at standing up for our values – of peace, democracy, tolerance, freedom. We must be more intolerant of intolerance – rejecting anyone whose views condone the Islamist extremist narrative and create the conditions for it to flourish.\nWe must strengthen our institutions that put our values into practice: our democracy, our rule of law, the rights of minorities, our free media, our law enforcements – all the things the terrorists hate.\n\nTo carry out an attack in the month when millions of Muslims are observing the holy month of Ramadan and to do so in the name of that faith is an insult to all Muslims worldwide.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with all communities who are affected and outraged by these events, and remain united in our determination not to let them divide us.\n\nAfter all, this is not the war between Islam and the West that ISIL want people believe. It’s between the extremists who want hatred to flourish and the rest of the world who want freedom to prosper. They will kill anyone that doesn’t adhere to their warped worldview – Muslim and non-Muslim. They demonstrate that day in, day out.\n\nWe have something the terrorists don’t. We have the great British spirit that triumphs in the face of adversity.\n\nIt’s the spirit we have always shown when we faced threats to our nation in our history. It's the spirit that saw London rebound after the 7/7 attacks, whose 10th anniversary we mark next month. It’s the spirit we saw as British tourists went to the beach in Tunisia this weekend, determined not to be cowed by the terrorists.\nWe are the people who stand up to hatred. They are the cowards who murder defenceless people on a beach. They stand for oppression; we stand for freedom, and a peaceful, tolerant way of life.\n\nThe flag flies at half-mast above Downing Street today. That reflects our sympathy with the victims and their families. Our hearts go out to them. But it also represents our resolve to protect our very way of life – and that is exactly what we must act upon.","2015-06-29 07:45:35+00","653092548048400_1011883455502639",1],[224,"This morning I chaired a second Cobra meeting focusing on the attack in Tunisia.

We have a consular team on the ground in Sousse helping those there. A further team of consular staff, police and experts from the Red Cross are arriving today to provide further assistance. We are working with the travel operators to establish if there is anything more we can do to assist them. We will do everything necessary to get people home, including those injured.\n \nLast night, I spoke to President Essebsi to thank the Tunisian authorities for their assistance and to discuss what more we can do together to tackle this threat. These were innocent holidaymakers, relaxing and enjoying time with their friends and families. Like the victims in France and Kuwait yesterday, they did not pose a threat to anybody. These terrorists murdered them because the terrorists oppose people and countries who stand for peace, tolerance and democracy wherever they are in the world.

It is also an opportunity to learn a broader lesson about tackling corruption.\n\nJust as with FIFA, we know the problem is there, but there is something of an international taboo over pointing the finger and stirring up concerns. At international summits, leaders meet to talk about aid, economic growth and how to keep our people safe. But we just don’t talk enough about corruption. This has got to change. We have to show some of the same courage that exposed FIFA and break the taboo on talking about corruption.\n\nCorruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems we face around the world today. It doesn’t just threaten our prosperity, it also undermines our security. Football is beginning a long journey to rid itself of corruption and it will take time, courage and determination to see through the reforms that FIFA needs. I believe world leaders must show the same courage and determination to tackle corruption around the globe.

Our task was urgent: to rescue our economy from the mire. With that economy now going in the right direction, we are once again on the brink – but this time, on the brink of something special. We have a golden opportunity to renew the idea that working people are backed in this country; to renew the promise to those least fortunate that they will have the opportunity for a brighter future; and to renew the ties that bind every part of our United Kingdom. We now have the mandate to deliver that renewal. And it starts with today's Queen’s Speech: a clear programme for working people, social justice, and bringing our country together – put simply, a One Nation Queen’s Speech from a One Nation Government.\n\nThe first task of a One Nation Government is to help all working people have security. And nothing is more crucial to that than a job. A new Bill will help to create two million more jobs this Parliament. That means there should be a job for everyone who wants one – in other words, full employment. To help people get those jobs, we’ll train them up; three million more will start apprenticeships over the next five years. We will also reward work by letting people keep even more of the money they earn – for the first time putting it into law that the Minimum Wage is and always will be tax free. That will be alongside a five-year tax lock which means there will be no income tax, VAT or National Insurance rate rises in this Parliament.\n\nFor too long we’ve been a two-speed country. Some could afford childcare; others could not. Some could afford a home of their own; others could not. A One Nation Government will change that. Our Childcare Bill will grant working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 3 and 4 year olds, and because of our reforms, for the first time, childcare will get proper tax relief. Our Housing Bill will dramatically extend the Right to Buy to the tenants of Housing Associations – putting home ownership within the reach of 1.3 million more families. We will require councils to sell high-value council houses and put the money into building affordable homes. We will get 90 per cent of suitable brownfield land ready for development. And we will build 200,000 discounted Starter Homes for young first-time buyers. All this will mean there are more houses for people to buy.\n\nThe second big focus of this Queen’s Speech is championing social justice. That starts with education: a decent schooling for every child, no matter where they’re from. Our school reforms in the last Parliament were bold; one million more children are now learning in good or outstanding schools. In this Parliament they will be bolder still: taking over and turning into Academies not just failing schools but coasting ones too, as part of our new Education and Adoption Bill; opening not just a few more Free Schools, but 500 more. Of course, there is nothing that embodies the spirit of One Nation and the cause of social justice more than our NHS, which is there for everyone, whoever they are, regardless of their ability to pay. So we will continue increasing spending on our health service, by at least £8 billion a year by 2020, and make it a truly 7-day NHS.\n\nWe will also continue our welfare reforms that help people into jobs, reducing the benefit cap further, to £23,000. Our reforms will incentivise work – so people are always better off after a day at the office or factory than they would have been sitting at home. That’s true social justice – not handing people benefit cheque after benefit cheque with no end in sight, but turning workless households into working households; the misery of unemployment into the purpose and dignity of employment; and the welfare system into a lifeline, not a way of life.\n\nThird, this Queen’s Speech will bring every part of our United Kingdom together. Our legislation will make sure this recovery reaches everyone, from the oldest industrial towns to the remotest rural villages. Our High Speed 2 Bill will help bring our great northern cities together in a Northern Powerhouse that rivals the biggest cities in the world.\n\nFor our different nations and regions to coexist as One Nation, people must have more direct power over the areas in which they live. So our Cities Devolution Bill will allow them to bid for an elected mayor, with far more sway over planning, transport, policing and health. We will have a Scotland Bill, a Wales Bill and a Northern Ireland Bill, and will put into practice our promises on devolution – making Holyrood the most powerful devolved Parliament in the world. Governing with respect means respecting the wishes of the English too. That’s why we will address the fundamental unfairness devolution causes in England, by introducing English votes for English laws. And the UK will have more control over its affairs, as we bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act. We will also legislate to have an EU Referendum before the end of 2017, putting the question to the British people for the first time in 40 years: the European Union – in or out. Underpinning all of this is security. With an Extremism Bill, an Investigatory Powers Bill and a Policing and Criminal Justice Bill, we will keep our people safe.\n\nThat’s our legislative programme. It’s challenging but doable; optimistic but realistic. It’s the bold first step of a One Nation Government – a Government for working people. And this is the Britain we’re setting out to create: a Britain where you can get a decent job, have a good education, buy a home of your own, have dignity when you retire, and feel safe and secure throughout your life. In the last Parliament we laid the foundations for that; in this Parliament we will use them to build something special. We’ve now got the majority we need. With this Queen’s Speech we’re going to get on and do it – for every single person in this great nation.","2015-05-27 15:29:26+00","653092548048400_990314177659567",1],[255,"You can see me on ITV's This Morning at 10.30 - talking about 30 hours free childcare for working parents of 3 and 4 year olds.","2015-06-01 09:00:14+00","653092548048400_992855907405394",1],[256,"I'm meeting EU leaders at the Riga Summit today.

Liberals can dream their dreams. But we in the Conservative party have got work to do.\"\n\nThe words of the late Iain Macleod were particularly relevant during an election campaign in which we saw Labour plotting new ways to spend people's money; the minor parties promising the earth with no way of paying for it; and only the Conservatives - the real party of working people - setting out the difficult decisions and bold reforms needed to make life better for people in this country.\n\nWe can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off. So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy.\n\nAs we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together and, five years on, nothing has changed. That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.\n\nBut the next five years will be about so much more than balancing the books. When we came to office in 2010, Britain was on the brink of disaster. As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special.\n\nWe can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot. We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no one settles for a life on benefits, so no one's background is a barrier to their success. We can become a place where every town, city and region has a stake in economic growth and political power, especially after so many have been left behind by previous recoveries and still feel remote from power. In other words, we can become one nation.\n\nThat, for me, sums up the task ahead. That's what we'll build in this parliament on the foundations we laid in the last. And it starts next week as we launch a programme of legislation that reaches right across our country, into every city, every community and every home.\n\nOur first aim is to help working people get on. The absolute key to getting on is getting a job. We created 2m jobs in the last parliament - more than the rest of the countries in the EU put together. In this parliament, we'll create 2m more - heading towards full employment: a job for everyone who wants one. We saw 2.2m people start apprenticeships in the last parliament. We'll help create 3m more, so our young people have the skills they need to do these jobs.\n\nWe'll also help people as they aspire to reach life's milestones. For those who want to buy a house, we're building more homes for them - plus helping them with their deposit and keeping mortgage rates low. For those who want to become parents and continue working, we'll deliver 30 hours' free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds. That's one nation: a country that says to people it doesn't matter who you are - if you work hard, you'll get the training, the job and the opportunities you need to succeed.\n\nOur second goal is social justice. Educational excellence shouldn't just be the preserve of the wealthy and the leafy suburbs. Free schools and academies are already putting paid to that notion: there are 1m more children now in good or outstanding schools and we've even got some inner-city free schools sending as many people to Oxbridge as some private schools.\n\nIn this parliament we'll go further. We won't just open a few new free schools, we'll open 500 more. We won't just take over failing schools as academies, we'll take over coasting ones too - because \"just enough\" is no longer good enough.\n\nAnd by lowering the benefits cap, we will make sure you're always better off in the office or factory than you are at home. \n\nOf course, there is nothing that embodies the spirit of one nation more than our National Health Service, which is there for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. So we will continue increasing spending on the health service, by at least £8bn a year by 2020, and make it a truly seven-day NHS.\n\nOur third task is to ensure we are one nation when it comes to our economic success. Last year saw a remarkable achievement: the north grew faster than the south. With some of the biggest infrastructure programmes we've seen in centuries, like High Speed 2, and unprecedented power devolved to cities, we will build the northern powerhouse that rivals the great cities of the world, and put people in charge of their own destiny.\n\nAnd we will follow through on our commitment to devolution in Wales and Scotland too - making Holyrood one of the most powerful devolved governments in the world. A British Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act will restore common sense to our legal system. And a referendum will give people the chance to decide finally whether they want to remain in the EU or not.\n\nThis one-nation approach exposes a fundamental difference between us and Labour. They seem to believe that to help some people you have to hurt others, reaching into the pockets of middle earners or heaping debt onto future generations. This zero-sum politics is an affliction of the left. Look at the SNP - they believe you make Scotland stronger by weakening England.\n\nAs Conservatives, we have a core belief: you don't pull someone up by pulling another down. I'm not saying that means protecting the rich. Under us, the top 1% of earners pay 27% of all income tax - more than they ever did under Labour. And we recently increased stamp duty on the most expensive properties. What I'm saying is you can help people on low incomes without hitting people on middle incomes. We'll prove that in this parliament.\n\nWe'll get even more people out of poverty by training them, creating jobs, increasing incentives to work - and at the same time we will help all the people like teachers and police caught in the 40p tax bracket by increasing the threshold at which you start paying it to £50,000.\n\nSo these are the challenges facing us as we return to office, this time as a majority Conservative government. Our task five years ago was rescue and recovery; this time it's renewal - renewing the idea that we are one nation, in which all working people can succeed; people of all backgrounds have social justice; and the ties that bind all parts of our nation are strong.\n\nOur legislative programme is the first step in achieving that - for every single person in our country.","2015-05-24 09:47:46+00","653092548048400_988720797818905",1],[253,"I welcome the probe into allegations of FIFA corruption and bribery, and support the FA's call for new leadership and reform.","2015-05-28 13:58:54+00","653092548048400_990908390933479",1],[254,"Congratulations to the people of Ireland, after voting for same-sex marriage, making clear you are equal if you are straight or gay.","2015-05-23 19:37:52+00","653092548048400_988429704514681",1],[258,"An important meeting with Nicola Sturgeon on delivering our commitment to more powers for Scotland.","2015-05-15 11:01:32+00","653092548048400_984659494891702",1],[260,"This is a government for working people: my message to Tetley staff in Eaglescliffe on my first visit since the election.","2015-05-12 18:48:59+00","653092548048400_983461598344825",1],[262,"I'll tell the first meeting of the Conservative Cabinet, \"We are the real party of working people, putting hardworking taxpayers first.\"","2015-05-12 06:47:49+00","653092548048400_983191368371848",1],[264,"Firstly, thank you so much for your support - not just during the election campaign, but over the past five years.\n\nTogether we have laid the foundations for a better future - and now, with a Conservative majority government, we must build on them.\n\nWe are on the brink of something special in our country.\n\nWe can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach for everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing.\n\nOur manifesto is a manifesto for working people. 3 million apprenticeships.

By Friday, you will either have me as prime minister or Ed Miliband. From that choice flow two completely different directions for Britain’s — and your family’s — future.\n\nI’m asking for five more years to finish the job we have started. I’m asking for five more years to secure our economy, so we get more people into work, more young people getting trained rather than sitting on the dole, more couples into homes of their own, more pensioners feeling security and dignity in old age.\n\nThe long-term plan we have been seeing through is improving lives. The world looks at us today and is impressed at the progress we have made together — from an economy teetering on the brink to last year the fastest growing major economy in the developed world. Two million more jobs; a thousand people striding into a new job every single day we’ve been in office.\n\nThese are the indisputable facts. Am I saying everything’s fine now? Absolutely not. There is so much more we need to do. I am determined to get back to my desk so from day one we can start cutting the taxes of 30 million working people, taking the lowest paid out of tax, funding three million more apprenticeships, building 200,000 more homes for young people, putting more money and more doctors and nurses into our NHS.\n\nThat’s why I have been to every corner of our country making the case — to see this job through and save our country. Because the alternative Britain could begin on Friday, with Ed Miliband in No 10.\n\nOver the past five years I have faced him over the despatch box at PMQs on a Wednesday. And as our economy has grown, as jobs have been created, he has had nothing to say. Our remarkable national turnaround doesn’t fit his narrative. He thought our economy would go into a triple-dip recession — but our economic growth has exceeded expectations. He thought we would lose a million jobs — we’ve created a million jobs. He was wrong time and again. When I hear him attack this government and what we’re doing to fix the mess Labour left, it brings to mind an image of a firefighter putting out a blaze, with the arsonist who started it standing next to him and criticising the job he’s doing.\n\nBecause the fact is, Labour helped to break our economy and they would do the same all over again. Their plans do not add up. They want to borrow more money than we can afford. They want to tax more and would reach into your pockets to do it — not just the super rich, that won’t cover it — but your family’s hard-earned money. And they want to pile up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to repay.\n\nAnd with Miliband being propped up by the SNP — as is inevitable, whatever he says — we would be looking at complete and utter chaos in government, with the SNP holding the government to ransom every time there is a vote in the Commons — demanding more borrowing and higher taxes to pay for more welfare.\n\nThat is the simple, inescapable choice tomorrow: me leading a strong and stable government, or with Ed Miliband, the chaos of being held to ransom by the SNP.\n\nYour vote can and will make a difference at this election. It’s that close. There is no room for protest voting, or voting for marginal parties — unless you are happy to get Ed Miliband in No 10. All the numbers show it: a vote for Ukip is a vote for Ed Miliband. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Ed Miliband. A vote for anyone apart from the Conservatives risks Britain and its economic recovery grinding to a halt. So when you are standing in the polling booth tomorrow, ask yourself this question: who will take our country in the right direction long-term: the people who helped mend our economy, or the people who helped to break our economy?\n\nBritain’s future is on a knife-edge. It would be a tragedy if we threw away all the hard work of the past five years and went back to square one. Together we can keep strengthening our economy, creating more jobs, investing in our health service, giving more young people a chance to get on in life. All this is within our grasp. We are on the brink of something truly special in our country.\n\nThe future can be brighter but only if we stick to the plan, and only if Britain votes Conservative.","2015-05-06 08:17:12+00","653092548048400_980087588682226",1],[278,"Great to meet mums and children at Stepping Stones nursery - telling them about our plan for 30 hours free childcare.","2015-05-06 10:24:22+00","653092548048400_980134982010820",1],[279,"A great welcome from farmers in Wales.

The SNP will hold the Government to ransom every time there is a vote in the House of Commons - demanding more borrowing and higher taxes to pay for more welfare.\n\nThe alternative is to vote Conservative on Thursday to ensure George Osborne is back in the Treasury and I am back in No10 on Friday. We'll continue the long-term economic plan - ensuring stable Government, a strong economy and a brighter future for you and your family. And at the centre of our plan is tax cuts for 30 million hardworking people - they are part of our balanced plan to ensure we stay on the road to a better future for everyone.","2015-05-04 06:23:03+00","653092548048400_979082725449379",1],[299,"Moving to visit the recently-opened Gurkha monument in Nuneaton, where the Queen’s Gurkha Signals regiment is based.","2015-05-03 20:23:18+00","653092548048400_978847325472919",1],[302,"People ask why I carry around the note Liam Byrne left in the Treasury saying “there is no money”. The answer is that I’m adamant we don’t forget what we found when we came to office. Labour didn’t just leave a note; they left shops with their shutters closed; deserted homes with repossession notices in the windows; parents going home to tell their children they’d lost their job. That’s the real story behind the “no money” note – the human cost.\n\nOver the past five years we’ve been turning that around. People who were thinking of writing this country off are now writing about us as the success story of Europe – creating more jobs than all the other countries in the EU put together. Companies such as Hornby that sent production overseas are bringing it back to Britain – one in six according to one study. Industries that were on the wane, like brickmaking, are being revived. We’re a net exporter of cars once again. Last year we were the fastest-growing major economy in the West, and we’ve halved our deficit as a share of the economy as well.\n\nIt’s because we’ve strengthened our economy that we have been able to do other things. Two years ago, we became the first country in the G7 to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on overseas aid. That isn’t some achievement on a league table; it’s  people in the Democratic Republic of Congo getting the vaccinations they need, children in Sierra Leone living free from Ebola, families in Nepal hit by that terrible earthquake getting the medical care they need.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting the environment, we have made some big decisions as well. We’ve set up the world’s first green investment bank. We’ve more than doubled the amount of renewable electricity we produce, and increased renewables generation capacity threefold. We’re the ones pushing for other countries to sign up to carbon reduction targets. We’ve shown it can be done – you can grow the economy and cut carbon emissions.\n\nAt the same time as strengthening the economy, we’ve taken real steps to fight poverty. This has led to 600,000 adults and 300,000 children being taken out of relative poverty. But I want to do more. That’s why we brought in the pupil premium – additional money for the most disadvantaged children. We transformed the welfare system, so work always pays. And, crucially, there are now more people in work than ever before – and there is nothing more vital to eliminating poverty than having a job and bringing in a wage.\n\nIn the next Parliament we want to help those on low incomes even further. We’ll do that by increasing the personal allowance, the amount you earn before paying tax, to £12,500 – meaning no one working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will pay any income tax. And to help all those parents who struggle to pay the nursery fees, we’ll double free childcare for three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week.\n\nThis is what we’ve achieved; this is what we plan – but it’s all at stake this Thursday. The economy is on the ballot paper. But behind the economy is the environment needing investment; lives depending on British aid; children waiting to be lifted out of poverty; parents crying out for help in making ends meet. It would be impossible to address any of those things with the higher spending, taxes and debt Labour and the SNP are planning.\n\nThere is only one way to deliver the things that matter – and that’s with a strong economy. And there’s only one party that can deliver a strong economy: the Conservatives. So if you want to see Britain continuing on the right path – not back in the hands of the people who left us that shameful note – that’s what you have to do on Thursday: vote Conservative.","2015-05-03 13:11:36+00","653092548048400_978636415494010",1],[304,"It’s a Bank Holiday weekend - when most people will have the chance to have a well-earned rest.\n \nAs you spend time with your family and friends, I’d urge all voters to take a moment and stop and think about the decision they have to make in just four days time.\n \nIt’s no exaggeration to say Britain will be making an historic choice.\n \nEd Miliband wants us to take a sharp turn to the left.  He sincerely believes more borrowing and more taxes will help you and your family. He is sincerely wrong.\n \nWorse - because he will lose so many seats to the SNP in Scotland - he cannot form a majority Government on his own.\n \nHe keeps trying to deny it - but it is a fact that he can only become Prime Minister with SNP support.\n \nNicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond will extract a heavy price for that support, vote-by-vote in the House of Commons. That price is even more borrowing and taxes to pay for more welfare.\n \nThat is the road to ruin.

They are coming to Westminster to break up our country - and we can't let that happen.","2015-04-19 14:12:17+00","653092548048400_970775546280097",1],[365,"","2015-04-19 13:10:48+00","653092548048400_970747622949556",1],[368,"More than 6 million people will have their chance to vote this week in the most important general election for a generation. Postal votes land on doormats from tomorrow. If you are at home, pen in hand, about to make your mark, the Conservative pitch could not be more clear: stick with the plan and the team that is turning this country around.\n\nConsider how far we have come. In 2010 Britain was on the brink of bankruptcy; last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the developed world. A thousand jobs have been created every day and 760,000 new businesses have started up.\n\nAnd it is not just the British economy that has been revived; it is the British spirit. In offices and factories there is a new and palpable sense of drive. In schools across Britain there is a growing culture of ambition for every child. In the aspirations of everyone who has started a business from their kitchen table, there is the spirit that has always helped these small islands to punch above their weight.\n\nOur long-term economic plan is changing people’s lives. There are parents, now in work, who are earning a regular wage. There are teenagers beginning their adult lives not by signing on but starting an apprenticeship. Thanks to the Help to Buy scheme, tens of thousands more young people now have the security of their own home. Thanks to major rises in the state pension, pensioners now have more dignity and security in retirement.\n\nFor five years we have been laying the foundations of a better Britain — a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can expect to be rewarded for their efforts. The manifesto I launched last week was a plan to build on these foundations.\n\nWe would fund 3m more apprenticeships; build 200,000 starter homes for young first-time buyers; radically extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3m more families. There would be help to let you keep more of your hard-earned money — no 40p tax until you’re earning £50,000; the income-tax free allowance raised to £12,500. For young families, we would double the amount of free childcare available to working parents of three and four-year olds; 30 free hours a week — £5,000 a year. For those who have worked hard all their lives, we would take the family home out of inheritance tax.\n\nA Conservative government would protect spending on the National Health Service — and we can do that because we have a strong economy. That’s why Labour’s claims on the NHS ring hollow. You can have all the compassion and good intentions in the world, but if you don’t have a strong economy the NHS is in trouble.\n\nThat’s true of everything — good schools, decent pensions, the defence of the realm: it all depends on a strong economy. That’s why we must see through our long-term economic plan and keep clearing the deficit. With the Conservatives, Britain will be running a surplus in just a few years, living within our means, with our head held high.\n\nWe can get there by 2018. And don’t forget — by 2017, you can have that in-out referendum on Britain’s future in Europe. I will negotiate, get a better deal in Europe to reduce immigration, then put the decision to the British people. Your choice. And to anyone whose pen hovers over the Ukip box on their postal vote, let’s be clear: a vote for Ukip works directly against the Conservative party and makes a Labour government more likely. Can you imagine Ed Miliband getting a better deal for Britain in Europe? Or actually doing anything on immigration? No. That’s another reason this election matters so much.\n\nSo a Conservative majority government would be strong, decisive and accountable. We are currently just 23 seats short of that majority. That’s why your vote really matters. Because the alternatives look — frankly — chaotic.\n\nThe most likely alternative is Ed Miliband and Labour propped up by the SNP: the party that would bankrupt our country and the party that would break up our country. Nicola Sturgeon and I can at least agree on one thing; Ed Miliband must answer the question: will you rule out any form of deal that involves the SNP propping you up? He refuses to answer that simple question, so we can assume that is his plan. And it would mean total chaos. Labour would have to negotiate with the SNP vote by vote, day by day. Every time Ed Miliband wants to pass a bill he will have Nicola Sturgeon making a series of demands on him — the hostage-taker asking for more borrowing, more taxes and more welfare. The British people will pay.\n\nGovernment would end up as a dog’s dinner of haggling and backroom deals. Meanwhile our economy could come to a juddering halt.\n\nSo this is the stark choice facing people voting this week. Don’t think your vote doesn’t matter — or that a vote for one of the other parties makes no impact on the overall picture. It really does, more than ever before. A vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for Conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government. Vote for Ukip or the Liberal Democrats and you take Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon a step closer to Downing Street — and our government, economy and country a step closer to chaos.\n\nIt would be a tragedy if all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people these past five years were to be ruined by Labour and the SNP. Our growing economy didn’t happen by accident — but it can end by accident, if voters sleepwalk to an outcome they never wanted.\n\nSo if you are considering voting Ukip or Lib Dem, I urge you to think of the chaos of a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes. Only a Conservative vote in your local constituency will keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out and secure Britain’s future.\n\nIf you want a brighter future for you and your family, please use your vote carefully. Let’s see through the job we’ve started — and make our great country greater still.","2015-04-19 07:30:36+00","653092548048400_970609722963346",1],[369,"It was an honour to address the Festival of Life - now a great British tradition - at midnight last night. #rccgfoluk","2015-04-18 12:33:13+00","653092548048400_970113039679681",1],[371,"I'm delighted pensions expert Ros Altmann will join a Conservative Government as Consumer Protection Minister - fighting for your rights.","2015-04-18 11:39:35+00","653092548048400_970079616349690",1],[373,"The one thing Nicola Sturgeon and I agree on - Ed Miliband must answer this simple question:","2015-04-17 14:51:24+00","653092548048400_969486856408966",1],[327,"This week, I've put the economy right at the heart of this election campaign.

Who do you want running our country – the people who helped to mend our economy, or the people who helped to break it?\n\nThe economy is the central, critical, irreducible core of this election. Everything depends on a strong economy. Every job; every pay packet; every business; every teacher’s salary in our schools; every heart operation in our NHS; every kind of help we can give the elderly and frail.\n\nThat’s why this week in the campaign is Economy Week. We will focus 100 per cent on the economy: what we will do and what is at risk.\n\nElect a majority Conservative government, and this is what you will get. On May 8, I would walk back into Downing Street, get back to my desk and immediately start driving through a plan of action for the first 100 days of a Conservative government. Whitehall will be called to attention. On day one, bills will start being drafted. And there will be some clear priorities for those first 100 days.\n\nFirst and foremost, a new law will be drawn up to ensure that no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all. This is about making sure that as we cut the taxes of 30 million people, the lowest paid are kept permanently out of income tax. It is a permanent measure to re-write not just the laws of this country but the values of this country. And it will be there as the centrepiece of the first Queen’s Speech of my new government.\n\nSecond, we will draft a bill for jobs and apprenticeships, to build on the extraordinary progress we have made. Two million jobs have been created since 2010 – but there will not be a moment of rest until we have reached our goal: two million more jobs; or full employment in Britain. On day one, we will start drafting a bill to include three million more apprenticeships, paid for by reducing the benefit cap to £23,000 – so that it is work, and not living on benefits, that really pays in our country.\n\nThird, we’ll press the button on a bill for enterprise. The past five years have seen 760,000 new businesses starting up. From the tech firms in Shoreditch to kitchen table start-ups in Birmingham, there’s been a return of the can-do spirit that has always helped these islands punch above our weight. This bill will help us reach our clear and stated aim: Britain the best place in Europe to do business by 2020. That’s on top of £10 billion of further cuts in red tape, trebling start-up loans to 75,000, and introducing our Help to Grow scheme, providing finance to fast-growing small firms.\n\nFourth, there will be a bill to deliver better schools – with more radical measures to ensure young people leave education with the skills they need. It will include new powers to force coasting schools, as well as failing schools, to accept new leadership, continuing the remarkable success story of Britain’s academy schools.\n\nFifth, there will be a bill to double free child care for working parents of three- and four-year-olds. With a Conservative government, they will get 30 hours a week – worth £5,000 a year – saying clearly to the working families of this country that we are on your side.\n\nAnd sixth: a housing bill to extend the Right to Buy to 1.3 million housing association tenants. Whatever the armchair critics say – usually from the comfort of a home they themselves own – this is about giving thousands more families the security of their own four walls, and I can’t wait to make it happen.\n\nOn top of all this, we will draft a European Referendum Bill; start the process of renegotiating in Europe on changes to welfare that will reduce immigration; and take the first steps to deliver a truly seven-day NHS.\n\nAll these priorities have a common thread running through them. They are about giving working people security at every stage of life.\n\nLet me put it this way. If our first term in office was about clearing up Labour’s mess and saving the British economy from ruin, our second is about building on that – so we can continue to turn the good news in our economy into something that makes a tangible difference to your life. The foundations are now laid, and we must build on them.\n\nOur vision is not some unreachable socialist utopia, it is a Conservative dream of strong families, real opportunity for young people, young couples starting out in a home they own together, the elderly well provided for, a good life within reach of everyone willing to work for it – all built on the solid foundation of a Britain living within her means again.\n\nBut that is just one side of the choice. May 8 could also mark the start of a new and unprecedented era in our country – the nationalists in one corner of Britain calling the tune for the rest of the UK as they hold Ed Miliband to ransom. We know the SNP’s tactics. Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond have made no secret of the fact that they will demand more spending – and therefore more borrowing, more taxes and more debt – from a weak Ed Miliband government.\n\nDon’t just take it from me. Independent observers at the IFS have said that debt would be £90 billion higher in 2020 under Labour’s plans. As they point out, “higher debt entails higher debt interest payments”.\n\nAnd what else does an unstable Ed Miliband-SNP government mean for you? Independent observers of the UK economy agree: higher mortgage payments – not to mention all the misery caused by lost jobs, businesses going to the wall, and higher taxes on families across Britain.\n\nSo this is the choice we’re laying out in this Economy Week: Ed Miliband locked in a death dance with the SNP, taking our economic recovery down with them; or the Conservatives back in government, with a clear plan, working every day to secure you and your family a brighter future.\n\nDon’t let them wreck all we’ve done. Make your voice heard – and vote Conservative to see this plan through.","2015-04-26 07:00:39+00","653092548048400_974767009214284",1],[334,"We only need 23 more seats to secure the economy - my message as I joined our candidate Giles Watling in Frinton-on-Sea today.","2015-04-24 18:34:40+00","653092548048400_973991755958476",1],[337,"There's a clear choice at this election: a stronger economy, or more of what got us in a mess in the first place.","2015-04-24 17:31:30+00","653092548048400_973967479294237",1],[339,"MPs shouldn't be voting on issues that don't affect their area.

That’s why I want to set out exactly the choice before you on May 7.\n\nI am not one of those politicians who says they ‘get’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private. Sitting in the House of Commons from 2001, I had a ringside seat on Labour’s complete failure on immigration – and it was infuriating.\n\nFake colleges, bogus visas, wide open loopholes, the wrong welfare incentives, sham marriages, an abject failure to deport foreign criminals, migrants bringing family members to Britain even if they couldn’t speak a word of English – a litany of failure. \n\nUnderpinning it all was contempt for the views of most British people. We all remember Peter Mandelson’s boast that Labour was practically ‘sending out search parties’ for migrants.\n\nThe mess took 13 years to create – and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around. Economic migration from outside the EU has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year. We have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories. \n\nThere are new charges for migrants using the NHS; there is no social housing unless you’ve been in an area for two years; and there is no housing benefit full-stop for EU jobseekers. Critically, we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out.\n\nOn top of all this direct action to control immigration, we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused; it was about British people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all, because of Labour’s welfare system. \n\nSo we have had a huge, unprecedented push on welfare and training, with two million young people starting apprenticeships, and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work.\n\nThe result of all this? Consider these remarkable two facts. Under Labour, for years, 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers. With the Conservatives, two-thirds of our job growth now benefits British citizens. That is a remarkable turnaround.\n\nI’m not saying there isn’t a lot more to do. It’s clear that, as our economy has taken off, the bigger issue has become migration from within Europe. And while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year, it remains the right ambition.\n\nSo why have many more EU migrants come here? Partly it’s our extraordinary economic success, with Britain creating more jobs than 27 other European countries combined. But large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare. These have been a powerful draw to EU workers.\n\nThat is why, in the manifesto we published last week, we had some very clear and hard-headed proposals. Elect a Conservative government, and I will start negotiating a new deal with Europe straight away. \n\nIt will involve: no benefits at all for EU jobseekers. If you haven’t got a job within six months, you’ll be required to leave. If you’ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you’ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad – ever.\n\nThis is what I’m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017.\n\nThe capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it’s also right that Britain – not just a compassionate country but a strong one too – does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again.\n\nThat’s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions – and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies.\n\nWe need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. \n\nOnly then will we properly get to grips with this situation – building confidence at home that people can’t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives.\n\nAll of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values.\n\nThis is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband.\n\nDo you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know.\n\nBut the facts of this election have changed – and it’s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It’s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it.\n\nAnd if you’re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win – and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration.\n\nSo this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe – and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum.\n\nIf you want those things, there’s only one way to get them: vote Conservative on May 7.","2015-04-24 07:00:20+00","653092548048400_973722985985353",1],[342,"On #StGeorgesDay, let's all be proud of our country's great past - and confident about our future.

That plan is working. Day by day, month by month, Britain's getting stronger: jobs are on the rise, the deficit's down, the economy's growing and wages are going further.\n\nAnd there's more good news for family budgets, with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent. \n\nAt a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable, these latest figures are a reminder that we're on the right track – and that doing things differently would put it all at risk. \n\nIt's a reminder that only the Conservatives have a plan to build a stronger economy, improve living standards and make families across Britain more financially secure.\n\nWe want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn. It is individuals – not governments – who know best how to spend their money. \n\nThat's why, in Government, we've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over £10,000 – and we will go further in the next Parliament. \n\nThat's why we've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years, saving a typical family £10 each time they fill up. \n\nThat's why we've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension, which will be £950 higher than it was in 2010. \n\nThat's why we're introducing tax-free childcare – helping out parents with hefty childcare bills. That's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills, putting more money in hardworking taxpayers' pockets.\n\nDon't just take me by my word. Judge me by my record in Government: we've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years, and will deliver 3 million more in the next five – giving young people the skills to go out and get a well-paid job. \n\nWe're backing business, industry and enterprise – creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008.\n\nWe're getting Britain building again, helping young people to own their own home. We've already announced 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers under 40. And we will now help first-time buyers save for a deposit.\n\nA strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation. And a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life. \n\nMums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children; grandparents who've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives, get a job, get a home, and make something of themselves.\n\nA Conservative Government after May 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you, your family and for Britain. \n\nStep by step, milestone after milestone. Last week it was a record increase in the minimum wage, today it's the rate of inflation. This Government has a long-term plan – and we're determined to make it work for you.","2015-03-24 11:17:38+00","653092548048400_955429477814704",1],[451,"As the old saying goes: to govern is to choose, however difficult the choices. In the past five years I haven’t been short of difficult choices to make, but I believe that, when we look back, people will see we made the right, long-term choices for Britain.\n\nYou saw it in last week’s budget. We chose a responsible, long-term budget over the usual pre-election giveaways. I remember sitting on the green benches in 2005, watching Gordon Brown at the despatch box, promising jam today and jam tomorrow, ignoring the fact that Britain was living beyond its means.\n\nWe have rejected that cynical approach. This budget did not contain any irresponsible extra borrowing. It did not use the boosts of low inflation and lower debt interest to fund giveaways. Instead we have directed our firepower to dealing with our debts. Back in 2010 we said we would get debt falling as a share of GDP by the end of this parliament. Many said it was impossible, especially given the eurozone crisis. But — by George — we’ve done it. What is more, we have set clear plans to get our country back into surplus by 2018. The sun is starting to shine — and we are fixing the roof.\n\nSo I hear Labour’s non-plans and short-term policies and I am deeply concerned. The security of millions of families rests on May 7, and yet major questions are left unanswered. How would Labour deal with our deficit? Just how much more would they borrow? What taxes would they increase? Where do they want to take our economy?\n\nThree years ago, Ed Miliband dashed over to Paris and said he wanted to follow the president: “We are in agreement in seeking that new way that needs to be found and I think can be found.” He wanted us to follow the same path as the new French government. But where has that path led? Unemployment over the Channel is almost twice what it is in the UK. Our economy is growing seven times faster than France’s. Imagine if Miliband had been free to pursue his French dream: the fallout would be felt in catastrophic job losses, falling living standards, eye-watering debt and fast-diminishing hope in our future.\n\nThe path we need is the path we are on — and it has two approaches at its heart, both of which were evident at this budget.\n\nOne: investing in tomorrow rather than today. This government has consistently put our long-term national interest over short-term gain. At budget after budget we’ve protected science and funded research. We’re building the first railway lines north of London since Victorian times, updating roads, investing in broadband. It would have been easier to give that money directly to people in tax credits or higher welfare. But we have always rejected the short-termism that held Britain back — and we did the same this budget. There were investments in science and technology; we are abolishing national insurance contributions for the under-21s, giving many more young people a brighter future; and making sure the foundations of our economy are strong means we can keep securing the future of public services like our NHS.\n\nTwo: rewarding those who work hard and do the right thing. For too long, those who did the right thing were punished. Savers got penalised for saving. Young people worked long hours in a fruitless quest to buy a home. Bankers boasted about paying less tax than their cleaners. Since 2010 we have been working to turn this around — from a fair state pension, to Help to Buy, to tax cuts for the lowest paid.\n\nThis budget built on that work. Another million of the lowest paid are being taken out of income tax. The savings tax is being abolished for 95% of taxpayers, so every penny you saved you will keep. A new Help to Buy Isa will mean more young people getting the keys to a home of their own: for every £200 saved, they will get an extra £50 — so if they save £12,000, they’ll have £15,000 to help get them on the housing ladder. Bit by bit, we are restoring the link between effort and reward.\n\nThese approaches are paying off. We are the jobs engine of Europe, with 1,000 new jobs created every single day since 2010. The deficit is down. We have the lowest inflation on record. Last year, ours was the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world.\n\nIt’s not just a bigger economy we are building, but a better one. Manufacturing is growing rapidly. Over the last year, the north grew faster than the south. Yorkshire created more jobs than the whole of France. And critically, the rewards of recovery are being spread more fairly. The share of tax paid by the richest is rising. The hardworking, lowest paid are feeling the wind at their backs as they pay less in tax — or none at all. The independent experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies have confirmed that living standards in 2015 are forecast to be higher than when we took office. In homes across our country there is a growing sense of hope and security.\n\nAll this presents a very clear choice to you on May 7: between competence and chaos. This is not about dry and dusty budget forecasts, but people’s lives. That’s why I urge the people of Britain to stick to the long-term economic plan that has got us this far — and make the right choice for you and your family.","2015-03-22 13:25:46+00","653092548048400_954500114574307",1],[453,"","2015-03-19 20:08:11+00","653092548048400_953206184703700",1],[454,"We will do everything we can to help the family of the British woman murdered in Tunisia.

Click 'share' to let friends know.\n\n— A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLAN THAT IS WORKING: The British economy has been transformed.\n\nOut of the ashes of the Great Recession, last year we were the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world. More than 1.8 million extra people are in work. The deficit has been cut in half. This didn’t happen by accident.\n\nIt’s because we’ve got a long-term economic plan – and for the sake of your job, your family and your future, we’ve got to stick to that plan.\n\n— 1,000 JOBS A DAY: Since the Conservatives have been in Government, 1,000 new jobs have been created every single day. We’ve created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together. So if you want Britain to keep on as the job-creating factory of Europe, then keep Conservatives in government.\n\n— CUTTING YOUR TAXES: Because we’ve lifted the income tax allowance to £10,000, chances are you’ve had a tax cut – like 26 million other people in our country. Why have we done this?\n\nBecause you worked hard for that money – and Conservatives think you should keep more of it.\n\nSo we’ve made a big commitment: Next time we’ll raise the tax-free threshold even higher – to £12,500. People working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will pay no income tax at all. Labour and the Lib Dems threaten to raise your taxes, we will cut them.\n\n— GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE A DECENT START: So far we’ve got a million more children learning in good or outstanding schools – and by investing £7 billion next time, we will create many more brilliant school places.\n\nOn top of that, we will fund three million more apprenticeships, so that instead of heading for a life on the dole, our young people are learning a trade and getting on in life.\n\n— MAKING BENEFITS MORE FAIR: Our welfare system was a soft touch for too long. It sent out the terrible message that it was better to stay idle than to work.\n\nSo we brought in a benefit cap – and next time we would reduce that cap to £23,000 per household. Why? Because many hard-working taxpayers in our country earn less than that.\n\nThis is about real fairness between who puts in and who takes out. The age of something for nothing is over.\n\n— DIGNITY AND SECURITY IN OLD AGE: For years pensioners were treated poorly. The people who fought the Nazis and built our country were fobbed off with pitiful 75p increases in their pension. It was a disgrace – and we’ve turned it around.\n\nThe State Pension is up by £950 a year. Benefits including free bus passes and winter fuel allowance have been kept.\n\nNext time we’d keep the pension rising by earnings, prices or 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest. We’d keep those free benefits – and keep ensuring dignity and security for the older generation.\n\n— MORE HOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE: We’ve pulled out the stops to get more people on the housing ladder. Help To Buy has got 77,000 so far into a home of their own.\n\nNext time we’d build Starter Homes across our country – especially for first-time buyers under 40.\n\nTens of thousands more people will have the brilliant feeling of standing in their own home, keys in hand, knowing “this is mine”.\n\n— PROTECTING THE NHS: It is one of the best things about being British: Whoever you are, however much money you’ve got in the bank, you can get help if you are sick.\n\nThat’s why we have protected the NHS budget, employed 9,500 more doctors, 7,500 more nurses, started a Cancer Drugs Fund and boosted dementia care and research. Next time we would make sure – once again – that healthcare spending goes up.\n\n— CONTROLLING EU MIGRATION AND HOLDING AN EU REFERENDUM: I will go to Brussels with a clear plan: No more benefits for EU jobseekers; if you haven’t got a job after six months, you must leave; no in-work benefits or social housing unless you’ve been here for four years.\n\nThen, in 2017, a Conservative Government would put our future in Europe to the British people in a referendum. In or out – you decide.\n\n— BACKING OUR BRAVE TROOPS: In an age of Islamist extremism and threats from across the world, it is vital that Britain’s forces have the best kit.\n\nThat’s why Conservatives plan to invest at least £160 billion in new hardware over the next decade, including seven new Astute-class submarines, the Joint Strike Fighter, and two vast aircraft carriers to patrol the seas and keep us safe.\n\nWe’ve taken money from fines imposed on the banks into veterans’ charities, and made the Military Covenant the law of the land. We’ve always backed our troops – and we’ll keep it up.","2015-03-01 13:24:30+00","653092548048400_943173052373680",1],[483,"We're building a Britain that offers everyone dignity and security in retirement.

He did so without fear, and never gave in to intimidation.

The production line had ground to a halt at the height of the Great Recession, and all the staff had been made redundant, save two, who had stayed to look after the machines for when – and if – they started up again. There I was, pushing the “on” button; and, for the first time in seven years, the kilns lit up, the cogs cranked into action – and the town was making bricks once again. More to the point, people who had lost jobs and struggled with part-time work had got back those full-time, properly paid jobs.\n \nThis isn’t just the story of one factory; it’s the story of our country over the past five years. Industries that were on the wane are being brought back to life. Companies whose orders were drying up are striding into new markets, from Colombia to Mongolia. Manufacturers that left Britain under Labour’s excess of taxes and regulation are returning to our shores – one in six, according to a recent report. We’ve got more tech companies starting here than anywhere else in Europe. We’re making more cars in Sunderland than in the whole of Italy. There are 760,000 more businesses in our country than in 2010. The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival, and it’s creating an incredible 1,000 new jobs every day: more than the rest of Europe put together.\n \nHow did this happen? First, because men and women kept their heads down and steered their businesses through some rough years. But I also think the Government has played its part, by putting enterprise at the heart of our long-term economic plan to turn Britain around. From this April we will have the joint most competitive corporate taxes in the G20. We’ve had thousands of entrepreneurs getting their ideas off the ground using Start-Up Loans. We’ve cut NI contributions and are scrapping the jobs tax for under-21s. We’ve halved the deficit as a share of the economy and made it easier to get finance. Add to that our planning reforms and our drive on exports and investment, and you can see Britain taking its place as one of the best countries in the world to start and grow a business.\n \nI didn’t do this because I think all businesses are perfect. Remember: I’m the one who signed deals with big firms so they exercise their social responsibility, such as Subway and Costa being transparent about calorie content. I’m the one whose Government put tax and transparency on the agenda at the G8 and is leading the world on countering tax evasion and tax avoidance, on making everyone pay their share; and our 40 changes to tax law have helped recoup £85 billion more in taxes this Parliament. And I’m the person who will go further: who will tackle the so-called “Double Irish”, where big firms move their profits from country to country to avoid tax.\n \nI did this because I understand that businesses are the principal job creators in our country. There are some politicians who think jobs are created in Whitehall by ministers. Conservatives understand they are created by brave men and women who are willing to put their neck on the line and start a new enterprise; whose great idea starts turning over money, and before long provides new opportunities and jobs for other people. For us, supporting businesses is not an end in itself; it’s a means to an end – an end that is more jobs for our people, more financial security for our families, and a brighter future for our communities.\n \nHere’s something else Conservatives understand: it’s successful enterprise that keeps our public services going. This year, businesses paid more in corporation tax to Treasury coffers than our spending on schools, defence or transport. Nothing illustrates better the importance of enterprise. So when our opponents try to portray the Conservatives as just on the side of business, they’re wrong. We’re on the side of hard-working people who want a job; who want to put food on the table; who want to get on, own a home and get decent public services.\n \nLabour don’t get any of this. Forget their comical turns this week – berating Boots one minute; trying to lavish it with praise the next; going on television to talk about how some of their best friends are businessmen, then forgetting their names. Frankly, that’s a sideshow. This chaos betrays something much deeper about Ed Miliband and Labour – something that should strike fear in every family in the country: they have a sneering hatred of business.\n \nIt was Ed Miliband, in one of his first major speeches as Labour leader, who took it upon himself to dub some businesses as “predators”. It was Ed Balls who said that one of the first things he would do as Chancellor would be to slap higher corporation tax on some of our biggest employers. As new analysis today shows, this policy alone could cost 96,400 jobs. That statistic demolishes one of their economic arguments; they say they would deal with the deficit by growing the economy, but with their anti-business policies, there would be no jobs and no growth. For Britain’s hard-working families, that would mean thousands more parents back on the dole, children going without, ambitions being stifled, all because Labour are ideologically blind to the link between enterprise and people’s prosperity.\n \nSince January, the big choices at the general election have been laid bare. On business, the choice is again between competence and chaos. It’s the competence of us and our long-term economic plan that’s securing Britain’s future; or the chaos of Labour, who pose a clear threat to every single hard-working taxpayer – to their jobs, their security and their future. Labour’s Britain is one of higher unemployment, more children growing up in households without a role model who works, and more of the misery we saw during their Great Recession.\n \nOurs is a nation that is the best place to do business, and, as a result, will hit our target of full employment: a job for everyone who wants one. A nation where we have the businesses paying the taxes we need, so we can cut people’s taxes, protect our NHS, improve our schools and run a budget surplus that will shield our economy from future shocks. I’m not saying the job is done – it certainly isn’t – but we are getting there. Bit by bit, brick by brick, we’re building a Great Britain truly worthy of the name. On May 7, we have to stay on this path – because that’s the only way to guarantee security for you, your family and our country.","2015-02-08 08:31:54+00","653092548048400_931757260181926",1],[519,"Visiting #Emmerdale to mark the success of creative industries in Yorkshire - and see a rehearsal at the Woolpack.","2015-02-05 17:14:58+00","653092548048400_930482413642744",1],[522,"Saddened to hear of the death of Sir Martin Gilbert.

My article for The Jewish Chronicle:\n\nLast weekend I joined the march on the streets of Paris surrounded by placards saying: ‘je suis Juif’.\n\nIn the aftermath of one of the darkest moments in Europe in recent times, people of all ages and backgrounds came together to show solidarity with those who had suffered. In the face of those who tried to suppress our values, the voice of free speech responded ever louder.\n\nThe idea that the Jewish people once again feel unsafe in Europe is a truly sickening thought that strikes at the heart of everything we stand for. While the situation here in the UK is significantly better than in many other countries, we too have seen a completely unacceptable rise in antisemitism.\n\nMy message to the readers of the Jewish Chronicle is clear. We are going to take that spirit from the march in Paris and we are going to fight antisemitism with everything we have got. My policy is simple: zero-tolerance.\n\nNo exceptions and no excuses. So let me be clear: no disagreements on politics or policy will ever be allowed to justify racism, prejudice or extremism in our society. Over generations we have built something incredible in our country: a multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy – and we are not going to let antisemitism destroy it.\n\nFirst, we are going to do everything possible to protect people. We have already protected police budgets for counter-terrorism and provided an additional £130 million for our agencies over the next two years following the increase to the UK threat level in August.\n\nIn addition, we have invested millions in protecting Jewish schools. And I was pleased to hear from the Jewish Leadership Council this week that the Community Security Trust has an excellent relationship with the police and that further work to protect vulnerable buildings is already underway.\n\nBut I want everyone in our Jewish community to know that if they want help or advice on security they should find an open door with the police.\n\nSecond, we need to deal with the causes of this security threat, not just its consequences. That means going after the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism that perverts the Islamic faith in an attempt to justify the most sickening barbarism and brutality.\n\nAs evidence emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offences, it is clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to encourage violence, but whose world view can be used as a justification for it.\n\nSo to defeat this ideology we need to deal with all forms of extremism – not just violent extremism. That is why our Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes for the first time an obligation on all public bodies to play their part in tackling extremism that can lead to violence and terrorism.\n\nIt is why we have banned extremist preachers, increased the resources available for programmes that prevent radicalisation and why we are getting extremist material taken down from the internet.\n\nSome may argue that this is not compatible with free speech. But I say we would not sit back and allow right-wing extremists or Nazis to recruit support in these ways. So we will not allow Islamist extremists this opportunity either.\n\nFinally, I want us to do more to educate people in our country about fighting prejudice and hatred. That is one of the reasons why I set up the Holocaust Commission which will be reporting on Holocaust Memorial Day later this month.\n\nI think it is vital that all our young people understand not just what happened in the Holocaust but also how it happened – and how the steps to prejudice and hatred led ordinary people to do the most extraordinarily awful things.\n\nThe Commission will ensure the memory and testimony of Holocaust survivors is faithfully preserved for ever – and that the lessons of the Holocaust can be learnt by young people in this country for generations to come.\n\nDefeating the poisonous ideology of extremism will take patience and determination.\n\nBut I promise you this: together we will beat antisemitism and we will make sure this remains a country that the Jewish people in Britain are proud to call home.","2015-01-16 13:45:45+00","653092548048400_918942018130117",1],[565,"Security and prosperity go hand in hand. My article with Barack Obama for today's Times:\n\nTwo hundred years ago this month, Britain and the United States fought each other at the Battle of New Orleans. It was the last major battle where our nations met as enemies. In modern times, our special relationship as allies and partners has been the firm foundation of our shared security and prosperity.\n\nTogether we defeated the Nazis and hunted down the core al-Qaeda leadership. Our scientists collaborate to transform our world, from discovering the double helix blueprint of life to creating the technologies that power our digital age. Our businesses, investors and entrepreneurs fuel the largest foreign direct investment relationship between any two countries in the world.\n\nOver the past few years, our governments have worked closely to restore economic growth, improve our living standards and make sure families get the help they needed.\n\nYet we know that progress and prosperity are never guaranteed. As we meet today at the White House, we reaffirm our belief that our ability to defend our freedoms is rooted in our economic strength and the values that we cherish — freedom of expression, the rule of law and strong democratic institutions.\n\nWe face pressing challenges, from promoting global growth, including growth and job creation in Europe, to combating global climate change. And as we were reminded so tragically again in Paris last week, terrorism, conflict and instability threaten the values that define us as free peoples. Today we recommit ourselves to our enduring mission: protecting our peoples, safeguarding our economies and defending our values. Once more, Britain and America stand together. Once more, we need strong and determined leadership to meet the challenges of our time.\n\nFirst, we must do all we can to bolster our economies against another global economic downturn. This means continuing our efforts to spur growth and support good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nTo start with, we must promote economic policies and reforms that will create jobs and promote growth that is sustainable and balanced.\n\nWe are working to conclude a comprehensive EU-US trade deal that would significantly expand trade between our nations and support new opportunities for millions of workers in both Europe and the United States. We also have to make sure prosperity is shared broadly.\n\nFor economic growth to be sustainable and meaningful, it must reach everyone, not just a few at the top. So we are working to help families to stake their claim to a better future and buy their first home. We are supporting small businesses, expanding apprenticeships, improving education for all, and backing increases in the minimum wage. And we are co-operating to promote clean energy, reduce our carbon emissions and build our resilience to the impacts of climate change.\n\nSecond, we will continue to stand together against those who threaten our values and our way of life. When the freedoms that we treasure came under a brutal attack in Paris, the world responded with one voice. Along with our French allies, we have made clear to those who think they can muzzle freedom of speech and expression with violence that our voices will only grow louder. Whether we are facing lone fanatics or terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State (Isil) or Boko Haram we will not be cowed by extremists. We will defeat these barbaric killers and their distorted ideology, which tries to justify the murder of innocents, whether children attending school in Peshawar, or girls forced to become suicide bombers in northern Nigeria.\n\nThere are more than one billion Muslims in the world, the vast majority of whom are sickened by the evil these terrorists claim to perpetrate in the name of Islam. The United States and Britain will continue to work closely with all those who believe in peace and tolerance. The terrorists know only how to destroy, but together we can do something infinitely more powerful: build security, strengthen justice and advance peace.\n\nFinally, we will continue to stand up to Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine. If we allow such fundamental breaches of international law to go unchecked, we will all suffer from the instability that would follow. Our strong and united response has sent an unmistakable message that the international community will not stand by as Russia attempts to destabilise Ukraine.\n\nWe will continue working in lockstep and putting pressure on Russia to resolve the crisis diplomatically. At the same time we will keep supporting Ukraine as it works to fulfil the economic and democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people.\n\nSecurity and prosperity go hand in hand. By confronting the terrorists who threaten us, standing together against Russia’s aggressive acts and continuing our efforts to advance our economic growth, we will continue to advance the security and prosperity that our people deserve.","2015-01-15 08:54:59+00","653092548048400_918321054858880",1],[567,"Fixing the roof while the sun is shining with apprentices at East Midlands Roofing College. #LongTermEconomicPlan","2015-01-12 13:38:19+00","653092548048400_916913131666339",1],[568,"I've had a full briefing from security chiefs.

They are monsters.\n\nThey make no secret of their desire to do as much harm not just in the Middle East, but to any countries or peoples who seek to stand in their way or dare to stand for values they disagree with.\n\nIt was an ISIL fanatic who gunned down four people in a museum in Brussels.\n\nSo, let me be clear.\n\nThe British people need to know that this is a fanatical organisation called ISIL, that has not only murdered a British hostage.\n\nThey have planned - and continue to plan - attacks across Europe and in our country.\n\nWe are a peaceful people.\n\nWe do not seek out confrontation.\n\nBut we need to understand.\n\nWe cannot ignore this threat to our security and that of our allies.\n\nThere is no option of keeping our heads down that would make us safe.\n\nThe problem will merely get worse, as it has done over recent months, not just for us, but for Europe and for the world.\n\nWe cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe.\n\nWe have to confront this menace.\n\nStep by step, we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL and what it stands for.\n\nWe will do so in a calm, deliberate way - but with an iron determination.\n\nWe will not do so on our own – but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but also in the region.\n\nBecause this organisation poses a massive threat to the entire Middle East.\n\nSo we will defeat ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.\n\nFirst, we will work with the Iraqi Government to ensure it represents all its people, and is able to tackle this threat effectively.\n\nWe will support the Kurdish regional government, who are holding the front line against ISIL.\n\nWe will help them protect their own people - and the minorities, including Christians, they have helped already - through our supplies of ammunition and through training.\n\nSecond, we will work at the UN to mobilise the broadest possible support to bear down on ISIL.\n\nThird, the United States is taking direct military action. We support their efforts.\n\nBritish Tornadoes and surveillance aircraft have been helping with intelligence gathering and logistics.\n\nThis is not about British combat troops on the ground.\n\nIt is about working with others to extinguish this terrorist threat.\n\nAs this strategy intensifies, we are ready to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with this threat and keep our country safe.\n\nFourth, we will continue to support the enormous humanitarian efforts, including using the RAF to do so, to help the literally millions of people who have fled ISIL and are now living in appalling conditions.\n\nAnd fifth, and perhaps most important, we will maintain and continually reinforce our formidable counter-terrorist effort here at home to prevent attacks and to hunt down those who are planning them.\n\nPeople across this country will have been sickened by the fact that it could have been a British citizen – a British citizen – who could have carried out this unspeakable act.\n\nIt is the very opposite of everything our country stands for.\n\nIt falls to the Government, and to each and every one of us, to drain this poison from our society and to take on this warped ideology that is radicalising some of our young people.\n\nThe murder of David Haines at the hands of ISIL will not lead Britain to shirk our responsibility, with our allies, to deal with the threat this organisation poses.\n\nIt must strengthen our resolve.\n\nWe must recognise that it will take time to eradicate a threat like this.\n\nIt will require, as I have described, action at home and abroad.\n\nThis is not something we can do on our own – we have to work with the rest of the world.\n\nBut ultimately our security as a nation, the way we go about our everyday lives in this free and tolerant society that is Britain, has always depended on our readiness to act against those who stand for hatred and who stand for destruction.\n\nAnd that is exactly what we will do.","2014-09-14 13:50:39+00","653092548048400_844688688888784",1],[579,"I spent today in the North West and - in this clip - I explain how we'll deliver a Northern Powerhouse:","2015-01-08 16:43:33+00","653092548048400_914683461889306",1],[581,"We stand absolutely united with the French people against terrorism and against this threat to our values – free speech, the rule of law, democracy.

The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a possible third recession, with high unemployment, falling growth and the real risk of falling prices too. Emerging markets, which were the driver of growth in the early stages of the recovery, are now slowing down. Despite the progress in Bali, global trade talks have stalled while the epidemic of Ebola, conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal actions in Ukraine are all adding a dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty.\n\nThe British economy, by contrast, is growing. After the difficult decisions of recent years we are the fastest growing in the G7, with record numbers of new businesses, the largest ever annual fall in unemployment, and employment up 1.75 million in four years: more than in the rest of the EU put together. But the reality is, in our interconnected world, wider problems in the global economy pose a real risk to our recovery at home. We are already seeing that, with the impact of the eurozone slowdown on our manufacturing and our exports.\n\nWe cannot insulate ourselves completely, but we must do all we can to protect ourselves from a global downturn. Working through the agenda at the G20, it was clearer than ever how vital it is that we stick to our long-term plan at home and at the same time play our part in the international response to the global challenges on which our economic security also depends.\n\nWhen we faced similar problems in recent years, too many politicians offered easy answers, thinking we could spend, borrow and tax our way to prosperity. Those were the wrong answers then; they are the wrong answers now. We are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past. Nor will be successful by listening to those who suggest we can hide away from the world.\n\nAs the global economy faces greater uncertainty, it is more important than ever that we send a clear message to the world that Britain is not going to waver on dealing with its debts. This stability is vital in attracting the business and international investment that delivers growth and jobs, and which keeps long-term interest rates low. So we will stick to our plan on the deficit and continue to use monetary policy to support growth without adding to borrowing or debt. The G20’s Brisbane Action Plan reaffirmed the critical importance of this approach.\n\nAt the same time, we need to carry on with our plan to rebalance our economy so that we see an economic and industrial renaissance in every part of our country. Our long-term plan is backing business by scrapping red tape, cutting taxes, building world-class skills and supporting exports to emerging markets. Underpinning all of this is our radical programme of investment in infrastructure. Again this was a central theme at the G20 and Britain is proudly leading the way. We are making the biggest investment in roads since the 1970s and the biggest in rail since Victorian times, connecting 40,000 premises to superfast broadband every week, and starting an energy revolution with the first new nuclear plant in a generation, the world’s first green investment bank and the largest production of offshore wind on the planet. This continued investment and support for business is vital in creating jobs and enabling Britain to compete successfully in the global race.\n\nBut protecting our economy also means forging international action to meet the big global challenges that threaten our recovery at home. At the G20 it was clear that the biggest of these are the threat of protectionism, the damaging effects of corruption and global tax avoidance, and the instability caused by conflict and disease.\n\nBritain is playing a leading role on each. At this G20 I brought together a crucial meeting between President Obama and fellow European leaders to insist on urgent progress on a comprehensive EU-US trade deal that could add £10bn to the UK economy alone. The new European commission must put this at the top of its to-do list. At a time when the Eurozone is stalling we cannot duck such an opportunity for growth. We should sign more deals with Australia, and with China and India too. We need to persuade more countries of the benefits of free trade and open markets for all our peoples and for the wider world. We are also pressing for reform of the World Trade Organisation so that poverty busting trade deals are put together, agreed and implemented more quickly.\n\nWe must also make sure that big businesses pay their fair share of taxes. Ensuring these taxes are paid is vital in sustaining the low taxes at the heart of our plan, enabling hardworking families and businesses to keep more of the money they earn. We reached a G20-level agreement to ensure that there is nowhere for large companies to hide to avoid paying the taxes that are due. The G8 meeting I chaired in Northern Ireland also forged a ground-breaking initiative to stop the true owners of companies hiding behind a veil of secrecy, tackling the cancer of corruption that does so much to destroy countries and increase the risk to our own security. In Brisbane we also reached agreement to extend this work to cover the whole G20.\n\nFinally, whether it is standing up to Russia’s illegal actions in Ukraine, dealing directly with the threat of terrorism from extremists or leading global action against Ebola, the steps we take to ensure our national security will support our economic prosperity too.\n\nFor example, at the G20 I forged a specific leaders’ statement on Ebola urging other countries to contribute to the international effort and support the development of safe, effective and affordable vaccines and treatments. Under my leadership Britain will always step up and play its part on the big development and security threats we face. Not just because it is morally right, but also because it is the best way of protecting our people and dealing with the instability that threatens our long-term prosperity.\n\nIn six months’ time, Britain will face a choice: the long-term plan that has seen it prosper, or the easy answers that would surely have seen it fail. By sticking to our long-term plan at home and standing up for Britain’s interests abroad, we will do everything possible to protect our economy and give hardworking families a secure future in a Britain they are proud to call home.","2014-11-17 08:59:18+00","653092548048400_882350275122625",1],[645,"As I said in my speech to the Australian Parliament, we have to deal with the threat of foreign fighters planning attacks against our people.\n\nSo we will be introducing a new Counter-Terrorism Bill, with new powers for the police at ports to seize passports to stop suspects travelling, and to stop British nationals who travel abroad to fight from returning to the UK unless they do so on our terms.\n\nNew rules to prevent airlines that don't comply with our no-fly lists, or our security screening measures, from landing in the UK.\n\nBut as well as dealing with the consequences of this threat, we also have to address its root cause.\n\nAnd let's be frank: it is not poverty, or exclusion from the mainstream, or foreign policy.\n\nNo, the root cause of the challenge we face is the extremist narrative.

Today the contrast between the Conservatives and Labour could not be more clear. One party is reforming welfare and limiting entitlements, the other wants to turn the welfare taps back on. We want brilliant new schools set up in the state sector, Labour has set its face against them because its friends in the unions don't like it. Conservatives celebrate the workers and entrepreneurs who create jobs - Labour demonises them and would make life more difficult for British businesses.\n\nAnd nowhere is the contrast more stark than on taxation. Labour wants to put up taxes on people's homes, jobs, pensions - even their deaths. Conservatives are committed to cutting your taxes.\n\nWe know the economic case for cutting taxes: in a competitive world we cannot afford to carry on as a bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation. We have to direct our resources to incentivising work through tax cuts and not incentivising welfare through extra benefit entitlements. We have to fight the notion that you can endlessly suck more taxes out of businesses and bite the hand that feeds.\n\nConservatives understand the progressive case for tax cuts too. Historically there have been all sorts of mechanisms that governments have developed to help people to enjoy a higher standard of living, from fixed prices to complicated benefit schemes.\n\nFor me, the simplest way to help with living standards is this: allow people to take home more of their own money. Put another way, which makes more sense: tax people's incomes heavily and then give them back some of that money in a complicated package of overlapping tax credits or benefits - often creating perverse incentives, meaning that even if people work more, they earn less? Or simply tax them less in the first place?\n\nBut quite apart from the economic and progressive cases for cutting taxes, there's the moral case. It is morally right that the rich pay their fair share in tax; and right that those who are able to contribute to our public services and safety nets do so.\n\nBut what is morally wrong is government spending money as if it grows on trees. Every single pound of public money started as private earning. Every million in the Treasury represents a huge amount of hard work: early morning alarms, long commutes, hours spent on the factory floor, the office, the hospital ward or the classroom.\n\nConservatives understand this basic point. Labour doesn't. Ed Miliband once memorably described tax cuts as akin to government “writing people cheques”; in his world, public money is for the minister to bestow magnanimously on the people. And when you start with that attitude, you end up with appalling government profligacy; billions wasted; a growing public leviathan that demands ever higher taxes from working people.\n\nNo one should doubt my position: with every spending commitment we must be mindful of who picks up the bill. It's easy for governments to trumpet what they spend money on - and claim a moral victory for it - but on the other side of the coin are those who work hard, many on low incomes, who would desperately like to spend more money on their family. The government has a moral duty to think of these people in any decisions made on tax and spending.\n\nIt's for all these reasons that over four and a half years, while reducing the deficit, we have also cut income taxes. We have taken three million people out of income tax altogether and cut the taxes of 26 million.\n\nIn the next parliament, we will go further. We have made two clear commitments. First, we will raise the tax threshold again, so that nobody earning less than £12,500 will pay income tax. This represents the most progressive, poverty-attacking tax change in the postwar era: it will mean one million more low-paid workers will not have to pay income tax at all; and it means most basic-rate taxpayers will pay £3,800 less in tax over the next parliament compared with the Labour plans we inherited.\n\nSecond, no one earning less than £50,000 will pay the 40p rate of tax. This is about recognising the millions of people who have worked so hard to lift Britain out of recession, bearing a large burden of tax with quiet stoicism. Conservatives don't just talk about being on your side, we demonstrate it - and collectively these commitments will benefit 30 million taxpayers across our country.\n\nFinancing these tax cuts while continuing to cut the deficit will be hard, but doable. In this parliament we will have made £100 billion of savings while cutting income tax by £10.5 billion. In the next parliament we plan to make £25 billion of savings while making £7.2 billion in income tax cuts.\n\nAnd of this I am in no doubt: Labour could not deliver any of this. Forget, for a moment, its complete lack of economic credibility; put aside the fact that it only ever proposes tax rises - on your home, on your business, on your pension. Just think of its beliefs. This is a party ideologically addicted to spending and borrowing and taxing.\n\nAnd this, for me, goes to the heart of the choice for May 2015. On one side, a Labour party offering more spending, more borrowing, more debt, more taxes to be squeezed out of every working person in our country. On the other side, the Conservatives offering a long-term plan that is working; tax cuts that are credible; a future that is more secure for you and your family.

The people of Scotland spoke; our United Kingdom remains united. As I said in Downing Street on Friday, now is a time for our country to come together, and to move forward.\n\nI have always approached issues of devolution as a patriot. I love the United Kingdom; I want to make it work; I want to keep this family of nations together – so devolution must be about how best we can live together.\n\nThat’s why I wanted to hold this referendum. The Scottish Nationalist Party has been a threat to the unity of the UK for a generation.\n\nThere was a clear and present danger that the SNP Government would set our country on a course for separation.\n\nI decided it was best to challenge that directly and to settle the question – and I am delighted we have done that this week.\n\nPut it this way: today is the first Sunday for a long time when we can say there is no question mark over the future of our United Kingdom. The line they were pencilling in on the map, just north of Hadrian’s wall, has been rubbed out.\n\nBut the No vote has not meant no change. As I and the other party leaders promised, the starting gun has already been fired on a major programme of devolution. New powers over tax, spending and welfare are on their way to Scotland.\n\nThe timetable is brisk, but achievable: a White Paper by November, and draft legislation published by January. It would have to be passed in the next Parliament.\n\nHowever, there is nothing rushed about the substance of what will happen.\n\nFor the Conservative Party, it is the result of a long process to work out a devolution settlement for Scotland that would last.\n\nOur Strathclyde Commission set out the most far-reaching proposals on Scottish devolution of any party.\n\nThis was started back in the summer of 2013. Indeed, it’s now the Conservatives who are the keenest of all the parties in Scotland to make devolution work by giving the Scottish Parliament real additional powers so its members take responsibility for their decisions.\n\nAnd – by leading from the front on this – Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives has emerged as the party leader with the most enhanced reputation.\n\nSo for the Conservative Party, these proposals were not the work of a week, but of many months.\n\nAs far as we were concerned, the motor was already running and we just needed all three pro-UK parties on board before we could get going.\n\nThis week the other parties got on board, we agreed a timetable for action, and we are moving forward.\n\nBut this moment must not just be about securing Scotland’s future in the UK – and celebrating that fact – but settling other questions whose time has come.\n\nThe challenge is to make sure our UK works for all nations. Millions of people in the rest of the UK have been listening to these debates, watching this campaign and rightly asking: ‘What will change for us? Why can’t we have the same powers and the same rights as those in Scotland?’\n\nThese are questions the Conservative Party itself has been asking for a long time.\n\nWhy should Scottish MPs be able to vote on what is taught in English schools, to reduce spending on English hospitals, or even vary English or Welsh income taxes, when under the new settlement English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland?\n\nIt is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way.\n\nAnd again, this is not a recent concern of the Conservative Party. I have argued for the past decade that we need ‘English votes for English laws’.\n\nIt’s been written there in our past three General Election manifestos: 2001, 2005 and 2010 – and I should know, I wrote the second and oversaw the third!\n\nNow I am Prime Minister, my position is this. If the Scottish Parliament will soon have a range of new powers: powers over income tax rates; to change benefits such as housing benefit; to increase spending, including on the NHS – then there is a crying need to reflect that across the UK.\n\nWhen we change our constitution – how we are governed – a new settlement has to be fair and lasting. Forcing English people to accept policies on schools, hospitals and taxes for which they have not voted is not fair and such a settlement could not last.\n\nOf course, devolution is not just a matter for nations. Power can and must be devolved more locally. I am a localist.\n\nThat’s why I’ve pushed unprecedented powers out to local government. It is why we have devolved business rates – because those who live and work in a town or city often know best how to put the fuel in the tank of their own local economy.\n\nAnd through our Northern Powerhouse plan, we are already having a conversation about what further powers our big cities should have.\n\nAll this is on the table – but to be clear, all this should happen in addition to further national devolution, not as a substitute for it.\n\nOur main focus now in Westminster must be addressing the English question – and again, a cross-party approach would be best. Conservatives and Labour worked together on this recent campaign for the good of Scotland and the UK.\n\nNow we should work together to ensure the voices of all the people of these islands are heard, and that a basic unfairness at the heart of our democracy is put right.\n\nSo at the start of the party conference season, the challenge to Labour and Ed Miliband is clear: either resolve this issue with us, or explain to the people of the rest of the UK why they shouldn’t have the same powers as we are rightfully devolving to the people of Scotland – why, for instance, Scottish MPs should be able to vote to vary income tax rates in England, when the Scottish Parliament is going to be setting Scottish income tax rates in Scotland.\n\nFor my part, I will do all I can to make sure the millions of voices across England and Wales are heard; that we have a truly fair settlement for the whole of the UK; and that we work out how best this family of nations can live together in the years to come.","2014-09-21 08:00:35+00","653092548048400_848042241886762",1],[681,"I'm appalled by today's attack in Ottawa.

These have been long years – but our national effort is finally paying off.\n \nWe are now growing faster than any other major advanced economy. Record numbers of people are going out to work.\n \nWe’re seeing new economic life spread across our nation, with exports growing fastest in the West Midlands and employment growing fastest in the North East and North West. All this means more peace of mind for millions of families; more parents coming home after a day of work knowing they are providing for their children.\n \nPut simply, our long-term economic plan is working. Great Britain is coming back; and May 2015 is the moment we either continue on that path – or throw it all away.\n \nWith a Conservative government, you know what you will get. We have already cut the deficit by a third; in the next parliament we plan to clear it completely and run a surplus. We have already seen record numbers of businesses take root here; in the next parliament we are committed to having the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20 – to keep jobs and investment coming to our shores.\n \nWe have already increased the state pension by £800 – and in the next parliament we will give you the right to pass on your pension to your loved ones tax-free.\n \nWe have already made some desperately needed reforms in our education system, insisting that children from the toughest estates must have exactly the same opportunities as those in the leafiest suburbs.\n \nToday 800,000 more children are learning in good or outstanding schools; and in the next parliament we will ensure that many thousands more get that vital start in life.\n \nWe have already cut the taxes of 26 million people, and as I announced at our party conference, the next Conservative government would go much further. With us, no one will pay income tax on the first £12,500 they earn, meaning those working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will pay no income tax. In addition, no one earning less than £50,000 will pay the 40p rate of tax – giving a tax cut to millions of families.\n \nAnd there is more: we would protect the NHS budget and continue to invest; build 100,000 starter homes for first-time buyers; fund three million apprenticeships, so more teenagers start life not by signing on but by striding proudly into a real career.\n \nAnd all of this comes back to one aim: to make Britain a country that everyone is proud to call home. I didn’t come into politics to notch up a few more points on our GDP figures, but to help my countrymen and women live better lives. This is the best nation on Earth – and we have the chance to make it even greater: a place where reward truly follows effort; where your destiny in life is not decided by where you’re from, but how much effort you are willing to put in; where we remain able to provide for the poorest, the sick, the elderly; where there is a sense that morally, culturally and economically our country stands tall in the world.\n \nA Labour Britain hardly bears thinking about. Imagine: the international markets wincing as the British government racks up more debt; interest rates and mortgage rates going up; businesses crushed under punishing taxes; jobs leaving our shores; the unions back in Downing Street; diktats and bureaucratic schemes raining down on our schools and hospitals; the sense of a great nation slipping back into decline.\n \nAll Labour offer is more of the same: more spending, more borrowing, more debt, more taxes. And Ed Miliband does not just have the wrong policies; he has the wrong priorities. In his big conference address, he forgot to mention the critical national task of reducing the deficit. I know the demands of this job, and that is just one glaring warning sign that he is not equal to them.\n \nSo this is the stark choice at the next election: the Conservatives or Labour. Let no one deceive you that there is a third way. A vote for Ukip is a vote for Labour. That much was proved in the recent by-elections. In Clacton, previously a Conservative seat, Ukip won. In Heywood and Middleton, Labour held their seat.\n \nTo those considering voting for Ukip on the issues of immigration and Europe, I would point you to our Conservative record. Non-EU migration is now at its lowest levels since the Nineties and we are committed to putting EU migration right at the heart of our negotiations in Europe. That comes from the first British Prime Minister to veto an EU treaty, get the European budget cut, and pull us out of the bail-out schemes that Labour signed us up to. We have also pledged to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act, ending the era of farcical human rights rulings handed down from Europe. And never forget: it is only the Conservative Party that is offering you that in-out referendum on Europe in 2017.\n \nThere would be a terrible irony if people who care about these issues voted Ukip – making a Labour government more likely. They would vote for controlled immigration and get the Labour politicians who opened Britain’s borders; who admitted they were “sending out search parties” for migrants. They would vote for change on Europe and get the Labour politicians who signed Britain up supinely to all the treaties and bail-out schemes that were not in our national interest – the politicians who even now refuse to give the British people a say in an in-out referendum.\n \nSo this is the straight fight next May: the Conservatives or Labour. Me, or Ed Miliband. We can continue with the long-term plan that is working, or wreck the progress we’ve made.\n \nTo coin a phrase, Britain is on the right track – and we must not turn back. That is our message now and for the next 200 days.","2014-10-19 08:49:03+00","653092548048400_865538150137171",1],[685,"Crime is down since the election - thanks to the hard work of the police and our action plan: https://www.conservatives.com/crimeactionplan","2014-10-16 18:31:12+00","653092548048400_863792790311707",1],[687,"","2014-10-15 16:50:26+00","653092548048400_863142627043390",1],[689,"The biggest-ever fall in unemployment in history - taking it below 2 million - is great news.\n\nOur long-term economic plan is working, but there's still much more to do.","2014-10-15 08:33:29+00","653092548048400_862896477068005",1],[692,"It's good news that inflation remains low.

But this is where Al Qaeda trained their terrorists. This is where 9/11 and countless other plots were hatched. An Afghanistan free from Al-Qaeda is in our national interests as well as Afghanistan’s. And now, thirteen long years later, Afghanistan can and must deliver its own security. \n\nThe work of defeating Islamist extremist terror goes on elsewhere. And because this threatens us at home, we must continue to play our part. Afghanistan is a country transformed since my first visit. Together we’ve made Afghanistan safer, and we’ve made Britain safer. Of course, the new government of national unity faces many challenges ahead but President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah have already shown the leadership that will be necessary to build a better Afghanistan.

It is a clear result.\n\nThey have kept our country of four nations together.\n\nLike millions of other people, I’m delighted.\n\nAs I said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our United Kingdom come to an end.\n\nAnd I know that sentiment was shared by people, not just across our country, but also around the world - because of what we've achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future.\n\nSo now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together, and to move forward.\n\nA vital part of that will be a balanced settlement - fair to people in Scotland, and importantly to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.\n\nLet us first remember why we had this debate - and why it was right to do so.\n\nThe Scottish National Party was elected in 2011 in Scotland and promised a referendum on independence.\n\nWe could have blocked that, we could have put it off - but just as with other issues, it was right to take - not duck - the big decision.\n\nI am a passionate believer in our United Kingdom - I wanted more than anything for our United Kingdom to stay together.\n\nBut I am also a democrat. And it was right that we respected the SNP's majority in Holyrood and gave the Scottish people the right to have their say.\n\nLet us also remember why it was right to ask the definitive question, Yes or No.\n\nBecause now the debate has been settled for a generation - or as Alex Salmond has said, perhaps for a lifetime.\n\nSo there can be no disputes, no re-runs - we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.\n\nScotland voted for a stronger Scottish Parliament backed by the strength and security of the United Kingdom, and I want to congratulate the No campaign for that - for showing people that our nations really are better together.\n\nI also want to pay tribute to Yes Scotland for a well-fought campaign, and to say to all those who did vote for independence: 'we hear you'.\n\nWe now have a chance - a great opportunity - to change the way the British people are governed, and change it for the better.\n\nPolitical leaders on all sides of the debate now bear a heavy responsibility to come together and work constructively to advance the interests of people in Scotland, as well as those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for each and every citizen of our United Kingdom.\n\nTo those in Scotland sceptical of the constitutional promises made, let me say this: we have delivered on devolution under this Government, and we will do so again in the next Parliament.\n\nThe three pro-union parties have made commitments on further powers for the Scottish Parliament.\n\nWe will ensure that they are honoured.\n\nAnd I can announce today that Lord Smith of Kelvin - who so successfully led Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games - has agreed to oversee the process to take forward the devolution commitments, with powers over tax, spending and welfare all agreed by November and draft legislation published by January.\n\nJust as the people of Scotland will have more power over their affairs, so it follows that the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland must have a bigger say over theirs.\n\nThe rights of these voters need to be respected, preserved and enhanced as well.\n\nIt is absolutely right that a new and fair settlement for Scotland should be accompanied by a new and fair settlement that applies to all parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Wales, there are proposals to give the Welsh Government and Assembly more powers.\n\nAnd I want Wales to be at the heart of the debate on how to make our United Kingdom work for all our nations.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, we must work to ensure that the devolved institutions function effectively.\n\nI have long believed that a crucial part missing from this national discussion is England.\n\nWe have heard the voice of Scotland - and now the millions of voices of England must not go ignored.\n\nThe question of English votes for English laws - the so-called West Lothian question - requires a decisive answer.\n\nSo, just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish Parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland, should be able to vote on these issues - and all this must take place in tandem with, and at the same pace as, the settlement for Scotland.\n\nI hope that is going to take place on a cross-party basis. I have asked William Hague to draw up these plans.\n\nWe will set up a Cabinet Committee right away and proposals will also be ready to the same timetable.\n\nI hope the Labour Party and other parties will contribute.\n\nIt is also important we have wider civic engagement about how to improve governance in our United Kingdom, including how to empower our great cities - and we will say more about this in the coming days.\n\nThis referendum has been hard fought. It has stirred strong passions. It has electrified politics in Scotland, and caught the imagination of people across the whole of our United Kingdom.\n\nIt will be remembered as a powerful demonstration of the strength and vitality of our ancient democracy.\n\nRecord numbers registered to vote and record numbers cast their vote.\n\nWe can all be proud of that.\n\nIt has reminded us how fortunate we are that we are able to settle these vital issues at the ballot box, peacefully and calmly.\n\nNow we must look forward, and turn this into the moment when everyone - whichever way they voted - comes together to build that better, brighter future for our entire United Kingdom.","2014-09-19 06:15:00+00","653092548048400_846948598662793",1],[737,"I've just spoken to Alex Salmond, congratulating him on a hard-fought campaign.

Please read and share this article with friends:\n\nAs the people of Scotland put pen to ballot paper next week, you will be writing the UK’s future in indelible ink. It’s a momentous decision: there will be no going back.\n\nThat is why the main party leaders – Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and I – have agreed the right place for us to be today is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister’s Questions in Westminster. There is a lot that divides us, but there’s one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together. At this crucial moment, we want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: ‘We want you to stay.’\n\nIt’s difficult to put into words what our United Kingdom represents. This is the group of small islands in the North Atlantic that have punched above our weight for centuries – and we’ve done so together.\n\nWhen the world wanted representation, we gave them democracy. When they wanted progress, we had the Scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution.\n\nWhen slavery bound innocent people, we abolished it; when fascism threatened freedom, we defeated it. A hundred years ago, our boys went off to war together – and they did so as comrades, united by purpose and hope for a better world.\n\nAs individuals and as nations, we have done extraordinary things. This is the special alchemy of the UK – you mix together Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland and together we smash expectations.\n\nAnd that’s just as true today as it’s ever been. Together we ensure that the sick are cared for in our NHS; that no one has to reach for their credit card to get decent medical help.\n\nTogether we ensure dignity and security for our elderly, with a pension system that we all pay into, from Land’s End to John O’Groats. Together, the United Kingdom embodies the values that the world looks on with awe and envy.\n\nJust because our countries are great together, that does not mean we cannot be even better. That is why a No vote doesn’t mean a vote for the status quo – No doesn’t mean no change. It means significant further devolution for Scotland – major new powers over tax, spending and welfare all being passed to Scotland.\n\nThis is not about Scotland versus the rest of the United Kingdom. It is about two competing visions of Scotland’s future.\n\nThis week, the No campaign set out more detail on this. Power for Scotland over how much money it borrows, what taxes it raises, how it spends that money – all agreed by November, all put into draft legislation by January. This is the package that Gordon Brown outlined on Monday. It is one I wholeheartedly support. Because we know that brighter future for Scotland rests not only on staying in the UK, but also on having significant new powers.\n\nThis is the sort of clarity you need as you make this decision, knowing how it will affect your life, your job, the security of your country, the money in your pocket – especially when you’re not just making this decision for yourself, but for your children, your grandchildren, and their children too.\n\nWith this timetable, we are giving people that clarity, showing that by voting No, Scotland gets the best of both worlds: power over the policies that matter, and the stability of the United Kingdom; the freedom to chart its own destiny, and the support of three other nations; the reputation in the world as a successful nation, and the clout of a world-renowned union.\n\nBut where we offer clarity, those who support separation offer only question marks. Just eight days away from the referendum, they are still unclear on what money Scotland could use without the pound sterling. The plan for Scotland to enter the EU is a blank page. The formula for filling the public services funding deficit is a blank space. While a Yes vote may be a lucky dip, a No vote is a guaranteed win for anyone who wants a stronger, more autonomous Scotland.\n\nThe United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. So let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart. Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together.\n\nIf we pull together, we can keep on building a better future for our children. We can make sure our destiny matches our history, because there really will be no second chances. If the UK breaks apart, it breaks apart forever.\n\nSo the choice for you is clear: a leap into the dark with a Yes vote, or a brighter future for Scotland by voting No. You can have the best of both worlds in the UK. You can have more powers in Scotland. And you can be part of a United Kingdom – standing tall, forging a more secure future in this world, building more opportunities for our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born. That is the next chapter in our history; we can write it together – but only if Scotland votes No next week.","2014-09-10 08:00:01+00","653092548048400_842521932438793",1],[750,"There is a lot that divides us - but there's one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together.\n\nThat's why all of us are agreed the right place for us to be tomorrow is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster.\n\nWe want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face.\n\nOur message to the Scottish people will be simple: 'We want you to stay.'\n\nDavid Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.","2014-09-09 11:00:01+00","653092548048400_842100149147638",1],[751,"Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Security. The peace of mind that comes from being able to get a decent job and provide for your family, in a country that you feel has a good future ahead of it and that treats people fairly. In a nutshell, that is what people in Britain want – and what the Government I lead is dedicated to building.\n\nBritain – our economy, our security, our future – must come first. After a deep and damaging recession, and our involvement in long and difficult conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is hardly surprising that so many people say to me when seeing the tragedies unfolding on their television screens: “Yes, let’s help with aid, but let’s not get any more involved.”\n\nI agree that we should avoid sending armies to fight or occupy. But we need to recognise that the brighter future we long for requires a long-term plan for our security as well as for our economy. True security will only be achieved if we use all our resources – aid, diplomacy, our military prowess – to help bring about a more stable world. Today, when every nation is so immediately interconnected, we cannot turn a blind eye and assume that there will not be a cost for us if we do.\n\nThe creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and extending into Syria is not a problem miles away from home. Nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war 10 years ago. It is our concern here and now. Because if we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain. We already know that it has the murderous intent. Indeed, the first Isil-inspired terrorist acts on the continent of Europe have already taken place.\n\nOur first priority has of course been to deal with the acute humanitarian crisis in Iraq. We should be proud of the role that our brave armed services and aid workers have played in the international effort. British citizens have risked their lives to get 80 tons of vital supplies to the Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar. It is right that we use our aid programme to respond rapidly to a situation like this: Britain has given £13 million to support the aid effort. We also helped to plan a detailed international rescue operation and we remain ready and flexible to respond to the ongoing challenges in or around Dahuk, where more than 450,000 people have increased the population by 50 per cent.\n\nBut a humanitarian response alone is not enough. We also need a broader political, diplomatic and security response. For that, we must understand the true nature of the threat we face. We should be clear: this is not the “War on Terror”, nor is it a war of religions. It is a struggle for decency, tolerance and moderation in our modern world. It is a battle against a poisonous ideology that is condemned by all faiths and by all faith leaders, whether Christian, Jewish or Muslim.\n\nOf course there is conflict between Shias and Sunnis, but that is the wrong way to see what is really happening. What we are witnessing is actually a battle between Islam on the one hand and extremists who want to abuse Islam on the other. These extremists, often funded by fanatics living far away from the battlefields, pervert the Islamic faith as a way of justifying their warped and barbaric ideology – and they do so not just in Iraq and Syria but right across the world, from Boko Haram and al-Shabaab to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.\n\nSo this threat cannot simply be removed by airstrikes alone. We need a tough, intelligent and patient long-term approach that can defeat the terrorist threat at source.\n\nFirst, we need a firm security response, whether that is military action to go after the terrorists, international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or uncompromising action against terrorists at home. On Friday we agreed with our European partners that we will provide equipment directly to the Kurdish forces; we are now identifying what we might supply, from body armour to specialist counter-explosive equipment. We have also secured a United Nations Security Council resolution to disrupt the flows of finance to Isil, sanction those who are seeking to recruit for it and encourage countries to do all they can to prevent foreign fighters joining the extremist cause.\n\nHere in Britain we have recently introduced stronger powers through our Immigration Act to deprive naturalised Britons of their citizenship if they are suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. We have taken down 28,000 pieces of terrorist-related material from the web, including 46 Isil-related videos. And I have also discussed the police response to this growing threat of extremism with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. The position is clear. If people are walking around with Isil flags or trying to recruit people to their terrorist cause, they will be arrested and their materials will be seized. We are a tolerant people, but no tolerance should allow the room for this sort of poisonous extremism in our country.\n\nAlongside a tough security response, there must also be an intelligent political response. We know that terrorist organisations thrive where there is political instability and weak or dysfunctional political institutions. So we must support the building blocks of democracy – the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the rights of minorities, free media and association and a proper place in society for the army. None of these things can be imposed by the West. Every country must make its own way. But we can and must play a valuable role in supporting them to do that.\n\nIsil militants have exploited the absence of a unified and representative government in Baghdad. So we strongly welcome the opportunity of a new start with Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi. I spoke to him earlier this week and assured him that we will support any attempts to forge a genuinely inclusive government that can unite all Iraqi communities – Sunnis, Shias and Kurds – against the common enemy of Isil, which threatens the way of life of them all.\n\nThe international community will rally around this new government. But Iraq’s neighbours in the region are equally vital. So we must work with countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the UAE, Egypt and Turkey against these extremist forces, and perhaps even with Iran, which could choose this moment to engage with the international community against this shared threat. I want Britain to play a leading role in this diplomatic effort. So we will be appointing a Special Representative to the Kurdistan Regional Government and using the Nato summit in Wales and the United Nations General Assembly in New York to help rally support across the international community.\n\nFinally, while being tough and intelligent, we must also be patient and resolute. We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a poisonous and extremist ideology, which I believe we will be fighting for the rest of my political lifetime. We face in Isil a new threat that is single-minded, determined and unflinching in pursuit of its objectives. Already it controls not just thousands of minds, but thousands of square miles of territory, sweeping aside much of the boundary between Iraq and Syria to carve out its so-called caliphate. It makes no secret of its expansionist aims. Even today it has the ancient city of Aleppo firmly within its sights. And it boasts of its designs on Jordan and Lebanon, and right up to the Turkish border. If it succeeds, we would be facing a terrorist state on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a Nato member.\n\nThis is a clear danger to Europe and to our security. It is a daunting challenge. But it is not an invincible one, as long as we are now ready and able to summon up the political will to defend our own values and way of life with the same determination, courage and tenacity as we have faced danger before in our history. That is how much is at stake here: we have no choice but to rise to the challenge.","2014-08-17 08:02:57+00","653092548048400_830463440311309",1],[776,"Support the campaign to keep the United Kingdom together - add a Let's Stick Together Twibbon to your profile: http://twb.ly/UWFY3WQP","2014-08-16 11:55:20+00","653092548048400_830065070351146",1],[777,"The UK's employment rate has seen the largest annual increase of any major advanced economy.\n\nOur long-term economic plan is helping more people into work - please \"share\" this important news with friends today.","2014-08-15 12:33:10+00","653092548048400_829623683728618",1],[779,"With entrepreneurs at the Home Business Summit.

As Margaret Thatcher and President Bush Sr pledged to continue to stand together, many might have thought that a new era of peace and prosperity would make this great security alliance less relevant. But today Nato is as vital to our future as it has ever been.\n\nWe meet at a time when the world faces many dangerous and evolving challenges. To the east, Russia has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal, self-declared annexation of Crimea and its troops on Ukrainian soil threatening a sovereign nation state. To the south, there is an arc of instability from north Africa and the Sahel to the Middle East. The growth of technology and globalisation, for all its great benefits and opportunities, has put power once reserved for states in the hands of the individual, raising the capacity of terrorists to do harm. The utterly despicable murders of two American journalists by Isil [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] are but the latest evidence of a brutal and poisonous extremism that murders indiscriminately and risks exporting terrorism abroad.\n\nThere are some who say that we shouldn’t get involved in addressing these threats. There are others who doubt if Nato can adapt to meet the challenges we face. It is crucial we address these beliefs head on.\n\nFirst, those who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century. Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home.\n\nAnd Nato is not just an alliance of friends who come to the aid of each other in times of need. It is also an alliance based on national self-interest. Whether it is regional aggression going unchecked or the prospect that foreign fighters could return from Iraq and Syria to pose a threat in our countries, the problems we face today threaten the security of British and American people, and the wider world. Our nations have always believed that we are more prosperous and secure when the world is more prosperous and secure. So we have a real stake in making sure they grow up in a world where schoolgirls are not kidnapped, women are not raped in conflict and families aren’t slaughtered because of their faith or political beliefs. That is why we have decimated core al-Qaeda and supported the Afghan people. And it is why we will not waver in our determination to confront Isil. If terrorists think we will weaken in the face of their threats they could not be more wrong. Countries like Britain and America will not be cowed by barbaric killers. We will be more forthright in the defence of our values, not least because a world of greater freedom is a fundamental part of how we keep our people safe.\n\nSecond, we believe that Nato can adapt to meet the new challenges we face. The changes we need are clear. With Russia trying to force a sovereign state to abandon its right to democracy at the barrel of a gun, we should support Ukraine’s right to determine its own democratic future and continue our efforts to enhance Ukrainian capabilities. We must use our military to ensure a persistent presence in eastern Europe, making clear to Russia that we will always uphold our Article 5 commitments to collective self-defence.\n\nAnd we must back this up with a multinational rapid response force, composed of land, air, maritime and special forces, that could deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice. All this will also require investment from Nato countries in the necessary capabilities.\n\nBritain and America are two of only four Nato members to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of our GDP on defence and other states must urgently step up their efforts to meet this too. This would send a powerful message to those that threaten us that our collective resolve is as strong as ever. But while a strong security response is essential, we cannot rely on our military strength alone. We must use all the resources at our disposal — military, economic and political.\n\nTerrorists thrive on political instability. So we must invest in the building blocks of free and open societies, including creating a genuinely inclusive government in Iraq that unites all Iraqis, including Sunni, Shia, Kurdish, Christian and other minority populations. When the threats to our security increasingly emanate from outside Nato’s borders, we must build more partnerships with others who share our values and want a tolerant and peaceful world. That includes supporting the partners who are taking the fight to Isil on the ground, as we have done by stepping up support for Kurdish and Iraqi security forces. And we should use our expertise to provide training and mentoring to forces elsewhere, whether in Georgia or the Middle East, strengthening the capacity of forces there to tackle local threats.\n\nWe must also work with international organisations such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to uphold democratic norms, which is why they have been invited to our summit. And we must recognise that we can and should use all levers, including those outside the alliance, such as the economic pressure that is being brought to bear on Russia’s economy.\n\nBy working together we are stronger, whether in standing up to Russia or confronting Isil. So in Newport today we must summon up the shared resolve that inspired Nato’s founding fathers. With more than 60 countries represented at the summit, we can build this proud alliance of transatlantic nations into a more effective security network that fosters stability around the world. A network that Britain and America will continue to lead not just because it is morally right to do so, but because it is only by supporting peace, democracy and human rights around the globe that we will keep British and American families safe.","2014-09-04 07:49:45+00","653092548048400_839667036057616",1],[757,"A country like ours will not be cowed by barbaric killers.

I think of the stories behind the statistics — sweethearts who never married, babies who never met their fathers, parents who received that dreaded telegram.\n\nOne of those stories is of my great-great uncle, Captain John Geddes. Despite emigrating to Canada, he came back to Europe at the age of 36 to do his bit, making the ultimate sacrifice. His name is carved on the Menin Gate in Ypres — one of 55,000 men who have no known grave.\n\nSecond, it is important we remember why we became part of this conflict. For too long we have heard from some that this was a pointless war — that Our Boys didn’t know what they were fighting for. But that is wrong.\n\nThey signed up to prevent the domination of a continent and to preserve the freedom that we cherish today.\n\nBritain was under threat — and those brave men went to protect it. Third, we must remember the impact the war had on us today. The right of women to vote has roots in the Great War. Lives are saved thanks to medicines first used on the Western Front.\n\nAnd Britons stand tall and walk free because of the freedoms our ancestors secured. Those are the reasons we should remember. And I want to ensure our commemorations do their bravery justice.\n\nDuring this centenary, every state school will send two children to the battlefields. War memorials across the country will be renovated. Victoria Cross winners will be commemorated.\n\nThe Imperial War Museum will inspire thousands of visitors. And tonight, people across the country will take part in the Lights Out campaign — and No10 will join them, switching off our lights at 10pm to remember those who died.\n\nAt the heart of all of this remembrance lies respect, admiration and gratitude.\n\nThat is what will be reflected at today's ceremonies — and I hope will continue well into the future.","2014-08-04 09:17:17+00","653092548048400_822208284470158",1],[793,"Poignant and moving #WW1centenary service at Glasgow Cathedral remembered the huge sacrifice of Commonwealth countries.","2014-08-04 10:21:59+00","653092548048400_822231917801128",1],[797,"Great news that nearly 40,000 people are on the housing ladder - and getting on in life - thanks to Help to Buy.","2014-08-01 13:10:15+00","653092548048400_820138404677146",1],[798,"Everyone needs to know about Labour's plans to hit hardworking families with more taxes.","2014-08-01 09:34:42+00","653092548048400_820045391353114",1],[800,"I joined John Bell to meet Melissa, who used New Enterprise Allowance to start Fresh Start Health in Lower Heswall.","2014-07-30 13:09:58+00","653092548048400_819048404786146",1],[803,"Great to meet the SEVENBRO7HERS brewery team - one of the 20,000 new firms helped by our Start-Up Loans.","2014-07-30 08:49:32+00","653092548048400_818933541464299",1],[804,"Theresa May and I met immigration officers in Slough today after several suspected illegal migrants were detained in a raid.","2014-07-29 10:21:18+00","653092548048400_818384824852504",1],[806,"My very best wishes to Muslims across the country and around the world celebrating Eid.\n\nEid Mubarak!","2014-07-28 10:42:00+00","653092548048400_817884044902582",1],[808,"Today's growth figures are a major milestone in our long-term economic plan.\n\nAdd your support: http://www.conservatives.com/backtheplan","2014-07-25 18:15:52+00","653092548048400_816521401705513",1],[811,"It's encouraging news that the economy is larger than pre-crash levels.

As Lord Mandelson has admitted, they were practically sending out “search parties” for people to come here. There was a failed points system, which allowed so-called “highly skilled” workers to come for up to three years to look for work; often, they ended up stacking shelves. There was an increasingly generous, no-questions-asked welfare system which drew migrants to Britain for the wrong reasons. And unforgivably, while we had the highest rates of migration in our modern history, we also had well over five million people of working age on out-of-work benefits.\n\nOver the past four years, we have been single-mindedly turning this around. Our goal is clear: an immigration system that puts Britain first. Achieving that means doing three things: clamping down on abuses of the system; making sure the right people are coming here for the right reasons; and ensuring the British people get a fair deal. Here I want to set out our progress on each – and the new action we are announcing today.\n\nFirst, clamping down on abuses. Some of the most egregious examples were those new arrivals claiming to be students, enrolling at bogus colleges. In one of these colleges, inspectors found no students at all; the excuse was that they had all gone on a field trip to the British Library. We have taken radical action, shutting down more than 750 of these colleges. Today we are announcing a further step to make sure colleges do proper checks on students: if 10 per cent of those they recruit are refused visas, they will lose their licence.\n\nIllegal immigration is another area that demanded harder action. Yes, that means effective controls at the border, but it also means taking action inside the country too. It was absurd that those who were here illegally could get a licence to drive a car, or rent a flat, or have a bank account. So since earlier this month, we have been revoking their driving licences – with 3,150 already withdrawn. From November, we will start introducing a system in which landlords have a legal obligation to check the immigration status of their tenants. From December, rules to prevent illegal immigrants from opening bank accounts will be introduced. And crucially, once illegal immigrants have been identified, we are making it much easier to deport them.\n\nI can think of few things more infuriating than seeing people who have caused harm in our country and who launch appeal after appeal to stay, with the line that they have a “right to a family life” – never mind the families whose lives they have shattered. So we have taken every possible step to change this through the Immigration Act, with some important measures coming into force this week.\n\nFrom now on, for example, we will have a policy of “deport first, appeal later”. This means that where there is no risk of serious harm, we will deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeal once they’re back in their home country.\n\nWe are also addressing the abuse of Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to a family life. Too many judges have treated this as an unqualified right. So we have written very clearly into the law that when weighing up these cases, judges must also consider the British public interest too. As far as this Government is concerned, the rights of law-abiding citizens come well above the rights of criminals.\n\nThe second big plank of our new approach is making sure the right people come for the right reasons. The success of this nation was built by millions of hands, many from overseas – doctors, teachers, inventors, academics, businesspeople – and succeeding in the decades to come means staying open to those who can really contribute. So we have been rolling out new visas for graduate entrepreneurs and the exceptionally talented, and establishing a much more robust system that accepts the right people with the skills we need. We have also set a cap on economic migration from outside the EU. Crucially, this has been done without deterring talent; the cap has been undersubscribed each month.\n\nWe’re also making sure people come for the right reasons – which has meant addressing the magnetic pull of Britain’s benefits system. We changed the rules so that no one can come to this country and expect to get out-of-work benefits immediately; they must wait at least three months. And we are announcing today that we are cutting the time people can claim these benefits for. It used to be that European arrivals could claim Jobseeker’s Allowance or child benefit for a maximum of six months before their benefits would be cut off, unless they had very clear job prospects. I can tell Telegraph readers today that we will be reducing that cut-off point to three months, saying very clearly: you cannot expect to come to Britain and get something for nothing.\n\nThird, we are making changes to put the British people first. Many have been annoyed to see their taxes going to those who have never paid into the system here. Labour ignored this resentment; but we have been acting. For instance, on housing, you can no longer come here and expect to be given a home instantly. Statutory guidance now ensures that councils only add people to housing waiting lists when they have lived in the area for two years.\n\nOver the past decade, there has also been concern about employers hunting out cheap labour from abroad, while too many young people are out of work. Some recruitment agencies have even been recruiting directly from elsewhere in the EU without British workers ever getting a chance to apply for the jobs. So we are banning overseas-only recruitment – legally requiring these agencies to advertise in English in the UK. And today we are announcing a further measure. In the past, all vacancies advertised via Jobcentre Plus were automatically put on an EU-wide job portal, too: this meant advertising more than a million vacancies across the EU. We are going to massively restrict this, aiming to cut back the number of vacancies posted on this portal by more than 500,000. Again, this is quite simply about putting British residents first.\n\nOf course when talking about getting young British people into work, the problem isn’t a simplistic one of too many people coming here – it’s also about too many British people being untrained, and too many thinking they can get a better income on benefits. You can’t fix your immigration problem unless you fix your education, training and welfare problems, too. That’s what we’ve been engaged in for four years: radical school reform; record numbers of apprenticeships; and a complete rewiring of our welfare system so that it pays to work. This is a long-term challenge, but progress is being made: while most new jobs used to go to foreign workers, in the past year more than three quarters have gone to British workers.\n\nTaken together, this is about building a different kind of Britain – a country that is not a soft touch, but a place to play your part, a nation where those who work hard can get on. Carefully and painstakingly, we are building an economy that has real opportunities for our young people; an education system that encourages them to do their best; a welfare system that encourages work; and an immigration system that puts Britain first.","2014-07-29 07:41:22+00","653092548048400_818341114856875",1],[809,"","2014-07-25 17:59:56+00","653092548048400_816516571705996",1],[810,"With the team at Pentland Brands - a great UK company doing so much to help pass a major economic growth milestone. #GDP","2014-07-25 10:22:37+00","653092548048400_816340991723554",1],[812,"IMF predicts UK to be fastest growing economy in the G7 - more growth means more jobs and more security for families.\n\nShare this graphic to let friends know.","2014-07-24 16:40:56+00","653092548048400_816010868423233",1],[815,"Dropped in to see some of the men and women of our Armed Forces who are playing such a crucial role during Glasgow 2014.","2014-07-24 10:35:33+00","653092548048400_815865741771079",1],[818,"It's been a delight to be the first PM to visit Shetland for 34 years. #BetterTogether","2014-07-22 18:24:20+00","653092548048400_814996555191331",1],[821,"Help support an end to child marriage and FGM by signing this pledge:\n\nhttp://www.girlsummitpledge.com/\n","2014-07-22 10:08:56+00","653092548048400_814797771877876",1],[822,"I'll make reporting FGM mandatory for doctors, teachers and social workers.

So too did 27 Australians, including members of a family who had previously lost relatives on flight MH370; 43 Malaysians and 192 Dutch citizens also died — a huge blow to our friends and allies. We stand shoulder to shoulder with those countries and with all those affected by this outrage.\n\nBut alongside our sympathy there is also anger. Anger that this could happen; anger that a conflict that could have been stopped by Moscow has been fomented by Moscow; anger that some in the West, instead of finding the resolve to deal with this issue, have simply hoped it would go away.\n\nWe must establish the full facts of what happened. But the growing weight of evidence points to a clear conclusion: that flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area.\n\nIf this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state, violating its territorial integrity, backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.\n\nWe must turn this moment of outrage into a moment of action. Action to find those who committed this crime and bring them to justice. But this goes much wider than justice.\n\nIn Europe we should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. We should not need reminding of the consequences of letting the doctrine of “might is right” prevail. We should not need to be reminded of the lessons of European history.\n\nBut we do. For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine.\n\nSitting around the European Council table on Wednesday evening I saw that reluctance at work again.\n\nSome countries, with Britain at the forefront, have consistently pushed for action that reflects the magnitude of the long-term threat. They tend to be the countries with the closest physical proximity to Russia and the most direct experience of what is at stake. Their own independence and nationhood have come at a high price. They never forget it. But others seem more anxious to make this a problem to be managed and contained, not a challenge to be met and mastered.\n\nElegant forms of words and fine communiqués are no substitute for real action. The weapons and fighters being funnelled across the border between Russia and eastern Ukraine; the support to the militias; the half-truths, the bluster, the delays. They have to stop.\n\nSome international crises are insoluble. Not this one. If President Vladimir Putin stops the support to the fighters in eastern Ukraine and allows the Ukrainian authorities to restore order, this crisis can be brought to an end. Of course there must be proper protections for Russian-speaking minorities. These issues can be addressed. But the overriding need is for Russia to cease its support for violent separatists.\n\nIf President Putin does not change his approach to Ukraine, then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia.\n\nThis is not about military action, plainly. But it is time to make our power, influence and resources count.\n\nOur economies are strong and growing in strength. And yet we sometimes behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us and the access we provide to European markets, European capital, our knowledge and technological expertise.\n\nWe don’t seek a relationship of confrontation with Russia. But we must not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent.\n\nSo let us be clear about what needs to happen.\n\nFirst, there must be immediate access to the crash site and the crime scene must be preserved. The remains of the victims must be identified, treated with proper respect and dignity and returned to their families. There must be a ceasefire. And there must be a full investigation into what happened. Russia will have plenty of information about these events which it must make fully available — and straight away.\n\nSecond, Russia must immediately halt supplies and training for the rebels. They do not represent the people of Ukraine. Without Russian support they will wither.\n\nFinally, we must establish proper long-term relationships between Ukraine and the European Union; between Ukraine and Russia; and, above all, between Russia and the European Union, Nato and the wider West.\n\nWhat form that relationship takes rests on how Russia responds to this appalling tragedy. Russia can use this moment to find a path out of this festering, dangerous crisis. I hope it will do so. But if that does not happen then we must respond robustly.\n\nNearly 25 years ago Britain hosted the Nato summit that ended the Cold War and began the process of ushering Russia back into the councils of the world.\n\nIn six weeks’ time Britain will host a Nato summit in Wales at which the relationship with Russia will again take centre stage.

To me they’re as British as the Union flag, as football, as fish and chips. \n\nOf course, people will say that these values are vital to other people in other countries. And, of course, they’re right. But what sets Britain apart are the traditions and history that anchors them and allows them to continue to flourish and develop.\n\nOur freedom doesn’t come from thin air. It is rooted in our parliamentary democracy and free press. Our sense of responsibility and the rule of law is attached to our courts and independent judiciary. Our belief in tolerance was won through struggle and is linked to the various churches and faith groups that have come to call Britain home.\n\nThese are the institutions that help to enforce our values, keep them in check and make sure they apply to everyone equally. \n\nAnd taken together, I believe this combination – our values and our respect for the history that helped deliver them and the institutions that uphold them – forms the bedrock of Britishness.\n\nWithout it, we wouldn’t be able to walk down the street freely, to say what we think, to be who we are, or do what we want.\n\nNewspapers wouldn’t exist. MPs like me would not have been democratically elected. And our property wouldn’t be our own. \n\nThe question is: should we actively promote this? I absolutely think we should. For a start, this is a matter of pride and patriotism.\n\nSometimes in this country we can be a bit squeamish about our achievements, even bashful about our Britishness. We shouldn’t be.\nOf course, we should teach history with warts and all. But we should be proud of what Britain has done to defend freedom and develop these institutions – parliamentary democracy, a free press, the rule of law – that are so essential for people all over the world.\n\nThis is the country that helped fight fascism, topple communism and abolish slavery; we invented the steam engine, the light bulb, the internet; and we also gave so much of the world the way of life that they hold so dear. \n\nAs President Obama put it when he addressed MPs and peers in Parliament: ‘What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world.’\n\nBut there are two other reasons why we should promote these values. The first is economic. I strongly believe our values form the foundation of our prosperity.\n\nThe Western model of combining vibrant democracy with free enterprise has delivered great progress and prosperity, but it faces a challenge from more authoritarian models of economic development, like in Russia.\n\nNow is the time to demonstrate confidence.\n\nThe simple yet profound facts that, in our system, governments can be defeated in a court of law, politicians can be voted out of power, and newspapers can publish what they choose: these things aren’t weaknesses, they are fundamental strengths.\n\nPut another way, promoting our values is a key way to economic success – and that’s why we will stick to our long-term economic plan of cutting the deficit, cutting taxes and backing businesses and families to get on in life. \n\nThe second is social. Our values have a vital role to play in uniting us. They should help to ensure Britain not only brings together people from different countries, cultures and ethnicities, but also ensures that, together, we build a common home. \n\nIn recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message: that if you don’t want to believe in democracy, that’s fine; that if equality isn’t your bag, don’t worry about it; that if you’re completely intolerant of others, we will still tolerate you.\n\nAs I’ve said before, this has not just led to division, it has also allowed extremism – of both the violent and non-violent kind – to flourish. \n\nSo I believe we need to be far more muscular in promoting British values and the institutions that uphold them. That’s what a genuinely liberal country does: it believes in certain values and actively promotes them. It says to its citizens: this is what defines us as a society.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? We have already taken some big steps. We are making sure new immigrants can speak English, because it will be more difficult for them to understand these values, and the history of our institutions, if they can’t speak our language. \n\nWe are bringing proper narrative history back to the curriculum, so our children really learn our island’s story – and where our freedoms and things like our Parliament and constitutional monarchy came from. \n\nAnd, as we announced this week, we are changing our approach further in schools. We are saying it isn’t enough simply to respect these values in schools – we’re saying that teachers should actively promote them. They’re not optional; they’re the core of what it is to live in Britain. \n\nFinally, we need to make the most of the things that bring us together as a diverse, unified nation. We’ve had a real run of events in recent years that have exemplified our national pride – the Diamond Jubilee, the Olympic and Paralympic Games; and this year the commemorations of the First World War and D-Day.\n\nEvents like these remind us just how much Britain has to be proud of. \n\nNext year it will be the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. Indeed, it was on this very day, 799 years ago, that the Great Charter was sealed at Runnymede in Surrey. \n\nIt’s a great document in our history – what my favourite book, Our Island Story, describes as the ‘foundation of all our laws and liberties’. \n\nIn sealing it, King John had to accept that his subjects were citizens – for the first time giving them rights, protections and security.\n\nThe remaining copies of that charter may have faded, but its principles shine as brightly as ever, and they paved the way for the democracy, the equality, the respect and the laws that make Britain. \n\nSo I want to use this upcoming 800th anniversary as an opportunity for every child to learn about the Magna Carta, for towns to commemorate it, for events to celebrate it.

If your pencil is hovering over the Conservative box — or if you’re wondering whether you’ll make it to the postbox at all — I’m writing this directly to you.\n\nPeople used to say there is no choice in politics anymore. With these elections, that has been blown apart. There is a vigorous national debate going on, with clear water between all the different parties.\n\nI welcome that — and here I want to tell you the three things that distinguish the Conservative Party from the rest.\n\nFirst: while other parties talk, Conservatives deliver. Nowhere is that more true than in Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats pay lip service to public opinion, but in reality think there’s barely any need for change in Europe. Ukip talk about the national interest, then vote against it.\n\nBeyond the mood music, there is only one party with a credible plan in Europe. I have set out, very clearly, the key areas we are renegotiating on: keeping our border controls; cracking down on benefit tourism; securing more trade; getting more control over justice and home affairs; and getting Britain out of “ever closer union”.\n\nOnce we’ve negotiated, whatever the outcome, the British people will have the final say on our future in Europe, with that in-out referendum in 2017.\n\nIf you’re reading this thinking “I’ve heard all this before” – I get it. I was watching, too, when Labour made Britain the doormat of Europe and signed British taxpayers up to eurozone bail-out funds. So I understand the scepticism.\n\nBut if you want proof that we will deliver, just look at our record. Those bail-outs Labour signed us up to? I pulled us out of them. When there was an EU treaty that wasn’t in our interests, I refused to sign it — the first British prime minister to do so. And we are the party who got the EU budget cut for the first time, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion.\n\nWe’ve proved we can deliver. And as for that referendum? I have made a clear and personal commitment: I would not be Prime Minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum. This is a fundamental principle for me.\n\nSo the lines are drawn: Labour and the Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say. Ukip can’t give you a say. It’s only the Conservatives who can and will give you a say in that in-out referendum.\n\nThe second distinction is this: while other parties favour short-term gimmicks, we have set out a long-term plan that is turning Britain around.\n\nIt’s a plan with five parts: reducing the deficit; cutting income tax; backing business to create more jobs; capping welfare and reducing immigration; and delivering the best schools and skills.\n\nIt is a plan that is working, with the deficit down by more than a third, 26 million people who have had their income tax cut, immigration down, welfare capped, 250,000 fewer young people in failing schools and more people in work than ever before.\n\nMost importantly, it is a plan driven by core Conservative beliefs: you shouldn’t spend what you haven’t earned; leave something better to the next generations; work is the best welfare there is; everyone should rise as high as their hard work will take them.\n\nThese are the values that inspired Margaret Thatcher to unleash a wave of small businesses and that drove Harold Macmillan to build a property-owning democracy.\n\nOur ultimate goal is not about gilt yields and bond markets, it is to give people more financial security; to give families more peace of mind; to help many more young people make the most of their talents and get on in life.\n\nThis is a long-term plan underpinned by our beliefs – and the contrast with Labour is stark. They’ve given us a succession of short-term gimmicks, underpinned by political opportunism: bank taxes they have “spent” 10 times over; an energy policy that turns out to be a con; a housing policy their own shadow housing minister said would not work in practice.\n\nThey’re flailing around because, ultimately, they have no ideas beyond the ones that got us into this mess — more spending, more borrowing, more taxes. The only party with a credible, long-term plan is the Conservative Party. The third distinction between us and the other parties is this: optimism vs pessimism.\n\nIt’s been said that I was a sunny optimist in Opposition who became a grim realist in Government. I don’t recognise that at all. I am more optimistic about Britain’s future than I have ever been. That’s because I’ve been to hundreds of offices, warehouses and labs across this country and seen Britain coming back.\n\nI’ve seen it in the faces of the entrepreneurs who come to Downing Street who have been unemployed, who got a £3,000 loan from the Government and who are now running their own businesses. This is optimism based on fact, not just faith.\n\nBut there are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about Britain. To them, pessimism equals patriotism. They insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse. Like Pte Frazer politicians, they are perennially crying out that “we’re all doomed”.\n\nTo me, real patriotism isn’t running your country down at every opportunity, it is seeing its strengths and building on them — because time and again, the doom-mongers turn out to be wrong.\n\nA few years ago, they said Britain was down and out; but now we’re one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. They said: “Jobs will be sucked away from our shores, never to return.”\n\nBut in recent years, we’ve seen several companies move production and services back to Britain, such as Hornby from India to Sussex, or EE from the Philippines to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe doom-mongers predicted that reducing public spending would slash a million jobs; but we’ve got 1.5 million more people going out to work. They said that if there was a recovery, it would only be in London and the South East. But today, where are exports growing fastest? The West Midlands. Indeed, exports from there are set to grow three times faster than Germany’s by 2017.\n\nThere is so much cause for confidence in Britain today. We have four of the world’s top 10 universities. We have a higher employment rate than the USA for the first time since the Seventies. And we, the discoverers, inventors and chroniclers of gravity, DNA, penicillin and the web, are inventing more of the products and ideas that are shaping our world: the chip in your smartphone, the bionic arm, the latest in artificial intelligence.\n\nWe are not just celebrating this success, we’re building on it: the first nuclear power station for a generation, the first new railway line north of London for 120 years, the biggest construction project in Europe in Crossrail. The Conservative Party is optimistic about Britain, and unashamedly thinking big for Britain. That is real patriotism.\n\nSo this is what the Conservatives offer: delivery over talk. Plans over gimmicks. Optimism over pessimism. Above all, the passionate confidence that Britain is on the right track.\nIf you believe these things too, then please — get out to vote, post your ballot, and have your say. Your vote matters.","2014-05-11 11:33:36+00","653092548048400_776539745703679",1],[948,"Proud to support #BringBackOurGirls.","2014-05-11 09:32:08+00","653092548048400_776494612374859",1],[949,"Since 2010, we've created over 1.6 million new apprenticeships as part of our long-term economic plan.\n\nI was really impressed by the apprentices I met today at the British Sugar factory in Newark.","2014-05-09 15:55:24+00","653092548048400_775563172468003",1],[950,"Tackling questions from staff and apprentices at HL Plastics in Denby. #LongTermEconomicPlan","2014-05-09 15:16:31+00","653092548048400_775545362469784",1],[951,"Great to meet pupils at Oasis Academy Brightstowe - the country's most improved school in 2012. #LongTermEconomicPlan","2014-05-09 08:10:06+00","653092548048400_775393849151602",1],[952,"Only the Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum on Europe.\n\nJoin the campaign: http://www.conservatives.com/europe","2014-05-08 13:49:38+00","653092548048400_774984942525826",1],[953,"The General Election is one year away.

I disagree. Many of the great political questions of our time are also moral questions – we should not be surprised and nor should we be dismissive when members of the clergy make their views known. \n\nBut neither should political leaders be afraid to respond.  Last weekend, the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, offered a critique of this Government’s welfare reforms. I respect his view but I also disagree with it deeply. \n\nArchbishop Nichols essentially made three points. He suggested that our reforms were based primarily around saving money, that the safety net against hunger and destitution no longer exists and that our reforms are not working.\n\nLet me address each point in turn.\n\nFirst, our long-term economic plan for Britain is not just about doing what we can afford, it is also about doing what is right. Nowhere is that more true than in welfare. For me the moral case for welfare reform is every bit as important as making the numbers add up: building a country where people aren’t trapped in a cycle of dependency but are able to get on, stand on their own two feet and build a better life for themselves and their family. \n\nLet's be clear about the welfare system we inherited. It was a system where in too many cases people were paid more to be on benefits than to be in work. A system where people could claim unlimited amounts of housing benefit – in London there were people claiming truly astonishing sums of £60,000, £70,000, £80,000 a year. A system where hundreds of thousands of people were put on Incapacity Benefit and never reassessed, essentially taken off the books and forgotten about. None of these things is defensible. And it is right both economically – and morally – to change them.\n\nThe founders of our welfare system believed in the principle of responsibility – and so do we. As I said on the steps of Downing Street on my first night as Prime Minister, “those who can should, those who can’t we will always help”.  Those who can’t work will be always supported but those who can work have the responsibility to do so. The welfare system should never take that responsibility away. Whatever your religious or spiritual perspective, I believe very firmly that it is wrong to penalise those who work hard and do the right thing while rewarding those who can work but don't.   \n\nSecond, Archbishop Nichols’ claims that the basic safety net no longer exists are simply not true. Let’s get the facts straight. Yes, we made the difficult but correct decision that benefits shouldn’t go up faster than wages. But the safety net remains in place. If you’re over 25 and looking for work you receive £71.70 a week in Jobseekers’ Allowance - £6.25 a week more than at the last election. If you’re under 25 the figure is £56.80 a week - £4.90 more per week than at the last election. \n\nWe are working through everyone who used to be on Incapacity Benefit to see who is capable of work – but those who can’t will still get the help they need. The safety net remains, too, for Britain’s families – child tax credit for the poorest families has increased by £420. \n\nThird, our welfare reforms are not just right in principle, they are right in practice too. As well as providing a safety net, a key test of a welfare system is whether it supports people into work. That simply didn’t happen under Labour. In spite of all the talk about so-called ‘boom years’ we saw a situation where almost a million and a half people spent the last decade out of work – and the number of workless households doubled. \n\nWe have started to change that. The number of workless households is steadily coming down – a quarter of a million more children in our country have  a role model who gets up in the morning, goes to work and provides for them. There are more people in work than ever before – 1.3 million more since the last election who are able to count on the security and stability of a regular pay cheque. \n\nOf course, we are in the middle of a long and difficult journey turning our country around.

I tasked the Cabinet Secretary with getting to the truth. He did so, and there are two main findings.\n\nOne: around four months before the events, at the request of the Indian Government, a single UK military officer provided some advice. But critically, this advice was not followed, and it was a one-off.\n\nTwo: there is absolutely no evidence of UK Government involvement in the operation itself.\n\nThis conclusion has been made after a thorough search of some 200 files and over 23,000 documents.\n\nBut let me be clear: I want the dialogue between this Government and the Sikh community to continue.\n\nBritish Sikhs have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life, from serving in two world wars to running businesses and playing a massive part in our communities today.\n\nI never forget this.

Here’s mine: to make 2014 the year in which Britain begins to rise.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? This Government has been working to a long-term economic plan. From 2010 to 2012 we focused on rescuing Britain from economic oblivion. Last year we moved to recovery, as the difficult decisions we took began to bear fruit and we bucked international trends.\n\nAfter three and a half years, it’s time for the next phase of that plan. 2014 is when we start to turn Britain into the flagship post-Great Recession success story. A country that is on the rise.\n\nWith record numbers of new businesses, we can be the enterprise capital of Europe. With the school system being fixed, record numbers of students going to university and more than a million young people starting an apprenticeship, we can out-educate the rest of the world.\n\nAnd this must work for everyone. For me, a Britain on the rise isn’t just a country that punches above its weight in the world; it’s a Britain where everyone who wants to work hard and get on can do so. A country in control of its destiny. A country where every person has the peace of mind to know they can make something of themselves and provide security for their family.\n\nDuring the recession I insisted we were all in it together. As we recover, let me be clear: we are still all in it together. The question now is how we move forward and make sure Britain and its people rise.\n\nThe first thing is we must not resurrect the dangerous thinking that got us into the mess from which we are now recovering. There’s an arrogance and complacency from the Labour critics of my long-term plan. They still advocate the great mistakes that led up to the Great Recession - more borrowing, more spending and more debt.\n\nLast month the Office for National Statistics revealed the recession that began on Labour’s watch was even deeper than we thought. The economy contracted by 7.2 per cent - the biggest fall since the war, costing every household £3,000.\n\nIf you doubt how disastrous a return to Labour-style economics would be, just look at countries currently following that approach. They face increasing unemployment, industrial stagnation and enterprise in free-fall. The opposite of what’s happening here. \n\nOur recovery is real, but it’s also fragile, and there are more difficult decisions ahead. A return to that economic madness would devastate this country.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I and my ministers will be explaining how the next phase of our long-term plan will help you and this country rise. It includes five simple parts:\n\nOne: we’re going to keep reducing the deficit so we deal with our debts, help keep mortgage bills low and don’t place an unsustainable burden on future generations. That’s why in 2014 we’ll be legislating for a Charter for Budget Responsibility, ensuring we fix the roof while the sun is shining.\n\nTwo: we’ll continue cutting income taxes. People must keep more of their hard-earned money. We’ll again raise the tax-free personal allowance, which, with our earlier changes, is worth an extra £58 a month to the average worker. What’s more, we’re freezing fuel duty again, saving drivers £11 every time they fill up.\n\nThree: we’ll carry on creating jobs by backing small business. I want 2014 to be a year where more young people are given the opportunities only a job can provide. That’s why we’re going to make it much easier for firms to hire young people by cutting the jobs tax for every business by up to £2,000. Meanwhile, we’ll continue with many infrastructure projects that bring prosperity and economic security to all parts of our country.\n\nFour: we’re going to keep capping welfare and controlling immigration, so our economy delivers for people who play by the rules. This year we plan to cap the country’s overall welfare budget – excluding the State Pension to ensure people get a decent standard of living in retirement.\n\nFive: we’ll carry on fighting to deliver the best schools for every child. A decent education is the best passport to success and 2014 will see a new, rigorous National Curriculum. We’ll also forge ahead with apprenticeships, making vocational education match academic education at every level.\n\nThis Government is in it for the long-term, doing what’s right, not what’s easy. We’ve come a long way already. Let’s make 2014 the year when Britain really starts to rise.","2014-01-01 09:11:06+00","653092548048400_706729946017993",1],[1157,"Happy New Year!","2014-01-01 00:05:03+00","653092548048400_706499776041010",1],[1159,"I told Tim in Yalding we'd help him recover from bad flooding by getting power back on \u0026 ensuring a quick clean up.","2013-12-27 14:21:03+00","653092548048400_704349439589377",1],[1160,"An enormous thank you to the Environment Agency and emergency services who are doing an amazing job with the floods and extreme weather.","2013-12-27 09:55:04+00","653092548048400_704264799597841",1],[1163,"Here's my reading of \"The Night Before Christmas\" which I did with National Literacy trust to encourage kids to read.","2013-12-24 20:02:28+00","653092548048400_702952336395754",1],[1165,"Christmas gives us a space when we can consider the things that we value most – family, friends and fellowship. It is a time for being hopeful for the coming year and to reflect on the one that has passed.\n\nLooking back, 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face. Together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families. This progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day, putting in the hours, running businesses and keeping our economy going. \n\nAnd there are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too – being good neighbours, running clubs and voluntary associations, playing their part in countless small ways to help build what I call the ‘big society’. Many of these people are Christians who live out to the letter that verse in Acts, that “it is more blessed to give than to receive”. These people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do. \n\n2013 was a significant year for the Christian faith – a year that welcomed The Most Reverend Justin Welby as the new Archbishop of Canterbury and saw His Holiness Pope Francis elected to lead the Roman Catholic Church. Both have come in with exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches, which should inspire Christians around the world. \n\nFor me, this season is also a time to think about the meaning of Christmas – the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that gives to millions.

Here I want to give Sunday Express readers my personal take on what we are doing to beat this terrible condition and why there is hope for the future.\n\nDementia is a national crisis. In the UK today about 800,000 people are living with the condition. Surrounding them are the many husbands, wives, daughters, sons and friends who are also profoundly affected.\n\nI have met many of these people and listened to their stories and I have been incredibly moved. It is hard to imagine what it must be like to watch someone you love slipping away from you, perhaps even unable to recognise you.\n\nYet every day hundreds of thousands of people face this challenge with patience, courage and love. They have my deepest respect and they have my pledge: we are transforming Britain’s response to dementia.\n\nFor too long we have stuck our heads in the sand. This is a condition that costs about £19billion a year in England, more than the costs of cancer, heart disease or stroke, and yet on everything from diagnosis to research funding we failed to keep pace. Dementia was ignored, played down or mistaken as a natural part of the ageing process.\n\nEarly last year I decided: “No more; we need to wake up and have a national fight-back against dementia.”\n\nSince then we have been acting across a number of fronts and I can tell Sunday Express readers that we are making real progress.\n\nFirst, we are working to improve the way we deal with dementia in the NHS, particularly on diagnosis rates.\n\nDementia is like any other disease; diagnose it early and you can make life a lot easier for people. So we have done a number of things, from an awareness campaign that ran on TV, to getting GPs to check more closely for signs of dementia.\n\nToday diagnosis rates are going up.\n\nNot as much as we want yet, so we will keep working to achieve our goals.\n\nWe have also been working to make hospitals more welcoming. For those with dementia, being away from home can be extremely distressing.\n\nSo we are spending £50million on making hospitals and care homes more dementia-friendly. The Royal United Hospital Bath is one of a growing number of hospitals that have dementia wards specifically designed to help patients feel more relaxed.\n\nThe second front we have been working on is getting the whole of society involved. As with any national problem, the answers cannot come from government alone. We need businesses, public services and whole communities to understand better how to help people with dementia.\n\nThis means thinking about everything from helping people access bank accounts to using public transport. Here again we are seeing great strides.\n\nLloyds TSB, Barclays and other major businesses have been training staff in how to make life easier for those with dementia. Above all, we each need to show more compassion and understanding. That is what Dementia Friends is about. So far more than 40,000 people have signed up and I am proud to be one of them.\n\nA key part of the training is doing simple mental exercises that help you understand what having dementia means in terms of someone’s everyday life. The goal is to get a million Dementia Friends by 2015 so I urge you to sign up and show your support today.\n\nThe final front is medical research.\n\nBecause we have got government spending under control, we have been able to double our funding for dementia to £66million by the end of this Parliament. That money is going to British researchers and doctors determined to tackle this disease.\n\nBacking the UK life sciences is a key part of our long-term plan to turn our economy around and, by investing more money in it, we can help create more well-paid jobs as well as accelerate research into dementia.\n\nI also believe that to beat this disease we have to work globally. We have scientists all over the world working in different laboratories using different data and trying different approaches but they are all fighting the same problem. We need to join up the dots, to have a worldwide push to beat this.\n\nThat is what we did with cancer, and with HIV and Aids, and we must do the same with dementia. That is why we are hosting the G8 Dementia Summit this week. We are getting the most powerful nations around a table to discuss this and I am determined we come out with a practical plan for action: joining forces on research, sharing expertise and accelerating progress.\n\nOur national fight-back against dementia will be matched by an international fight-back and we can be proud that Britain is leading the way.\n\nSo we are seeing some great changes in our country: higher diagnosis rates, better care, more compassion and now, a truly global effort.\n\nAll these things should give us hope and the confidence that ours will be the generation that beats dementia.","2013-12-08 12:09:12+00","653092548048400_695098183847836",1],[1198,"Supporting Small Business Saturday UK by picking up lamb chops from Cobbs Butchers - I'm cooking dinner for my mum tonight.","2013-12-07 11:07:39+00","653092548048400_694596607231327",1],[1199,"We are doing everything we can to support small businesses - join http://www.TheSmallBusinessCampaign.com/ today","2013-12-07 09:00:18+00","653092548048400_694558473901807",1],[1200,"What I wrote in the Nelson Mandela condolence book, quoting, \"Blessed are the peacemakers...\"","2013-12-06 10:50:42+00","653092548048400_694107737280214",1],[1202,"Thank you to the staff at South Africa House where I've signed the Nelson Mandela book of condolence.","2013-12-06 09:56:11+00","653092548048400_694091763948478",1],[1203,"I've spoken to the Speaker and there will be statements and tributes to Nelson Mandela in the House on Monday.","2013-12-05 22:57:29+00","653092548048400_693855253972129",1],[1206,"","2013-12-05 18:12:50+00","653092548048400_693735093984145",1],[1208,"","2013-12-05 17:38:49+00","653092548048400_693724727318515",1],[1210,"The end of a successful #UKChina trip. £6billion of deals and a step up in the relationship between the UK and China. #GlobalRace","2013-12-04 15:04:01+00","653092548048400_693205787370409",1],[1211,"Learning English is a key part of schooling for these Chinese 6 year olds - more British children should learn Mandarin. #GlobalRace","2013-12-04 14:02:06+00","653092548048400_693174610706860",1],[1214,"Visiting the Du Fu museum in Chengdu, which celebrates China's greatest poet. #UKChina","2013-12-04 10:33:03+00","653092548048400_693113920712929",1],[1164,"I'm across plans to get electricity to many without power.

The whole thing is vivid in my memory: how he never stopped smiling; and how gracious he was to Samantha and me.\n \nMandela’s passing is a time of great sadness for billions around the world. For the politicians among us, it is a time to reflect, too, on how he achieved such great things. Of course the times have changed and the challenges are different. There is no standard template for successful leadership, and no way to replicate the unique gifts that Mandela had. But in a world of economic challenge, social upheaval, and new and ever more complex security threats, there are clear political lessons that ring out from his story – and every politician should heed them.\n \nThere is the lesson that history is not written for us, but by us; that individuals and movements can over-turn what had seemed totally and gloomily inevitable. In mid-century South Africa the status quo was set in cement. The very idea that a black man could rise to become President would have seemed impossible. Mandela’s story is a challenge to anyone lazily thinking that we are running on the rails to a certain destiny. It’s not true. Our destinies – whether personal or national – are not decided by impersonal forces beyond our control, but by the actions we take now.\n \nThere is the lesson that government is no excuse to give up on your ideals. All governing politicians know the sharp reality-check of taking office, but Mandela refused to put the brakes on his ambition. Once in government he set to work re-building South Africa – extending free healthcare to children, building vital infrastructure and housing nearly 3 million people. His story in office is a riposte to everyone who decides nothing can be done, or that the system says no.\n \nThere is the lesson that the popularity of a policy is not always a guide to whether it is right. Mandela’s fight against HIV is a shining example. He walked out of prison into a South Africa that did not recognise the slow and devastating creep of HIV. When in Opposition I visited him in South Africa and I went to an AIDS respite centre and orphanage. I will never forget the rooms of mothers dying slowly. He himself admitted that during his time as President he failed to confront the issue. But he had the courage and humility to recognise this and the resolve to do something about it.\n \nI remember hearing him talk about it and thinking how progressive he was for a man for whom the outside world had been put on pause for nearly 30 years. Against a groundswell of public opinion warning him not to go near the issue, Mandela acted. He challenged the widespread view that HIV did not cause AIDS, which was preventing South Africa from confronting the scale of the challenge. He stood up for South Africans who were living with HIV and battling for access to the treatments that could keep them alive. And his moving revelation that his own son Makgatho had died of AIDS led a sea change of public opinion that spurred the nation to respond. There is a lesson there for all politicians: the best opinions are formed not in the court of public opinion but the privacy of your own conscience.\n \nAnd the biggest lesson, to me, is the way he conducted politics: his extraordinary magnanimity and grace. Nearly three decades in a prison cell could have so easily seeded bitterness. On taking office he had a choice to make between vengeance and forgiveness – and he chose the latter in an astonishing way. De Klerk and other national party officials were brought into his cabinet; and the Truth and Reconciliation committee was set up to wipe the slate of past wrongs and write a new chapter for South Africa. Mandela knew that recrimination would have meant more violence and wasted time in a country that had already suffered too much. He knew the right course was to turn away from the acrimony and hostility that pollutes politics and gets in the way of progress.\n \nSometimes it can seem unfashionable to talk about morality. But Nelson Mandela stands out because of his moral authority. This was a man who fought and won on the moral causes of his time. A man who was prepared to stand up for what is right, even though he could not know what the outcome of his actions would be. A man whose actions lived out his words like no other – prepared to go to jail for his beliefs, and prepared when in government to reject the pull towards negativity, revenge and division in favour of demanding and inspiring harmony.\n \nIf we can show the same moral authority in our own politics, it won’t just represent the best possible tribute to one of the greatest leaders the world has ever known.

We’ve only been able to do this because we have taken the difficult decisions and our economic plan is working.\n\nLater this week, we’ll announce further help: proposals that will be worth around £50 on average to energy bill-payers. We’re doing it without taking any help away from poor families or sacrificing our green commitments; and in a way that will keep Britain’s lights on in the long-term too.\n\nWhen you look at your bill you see it is made up of various costs. Some of these we can’t control. Most of what you pay is determined by the price of energy in the global market – the gas and oil we’re buying from the Middle East or Europe. Politicians in the UK cannot wave a magic wand over these prices – and to pretend you can is fantasy politics.\n\nBut there are bits that Government can control: the parts of your bill that go to helping the poorest families heat their homes, and to making Britain more energy efficient.\n\nSome say we should drop these commitments entirely – but we do not agree. As we approach winter, we refuse to turn our backs on the worst-off families. And if we abandon our green commitments, it is our children and grandchildren who’ll pay the price.\n\nThis Coalition Government has never pursued quick fixes today when they’ll hurt people tomorrow – and we’re not going to start now.\n\nSo we are going to stick to these commitments – but we are not going to ask you to pay for all of them through your bills.\n\nThe 2 million poorest families who currently receive a discount on gas and electricity will continue to do so, but Government will pay for it. We’re able to afford this because we have cracked down on tax avoidance – leaving us more money to help struggling families.\n\nWe’re also changing the way we fund improving energy efficiency in Britain's homes.\n\nWe'll all be better off when our homes lose less heat, so we want the energy companies to help insulate as many homes as possible over the next decade.\n\nBut - apart from in the worst off homes - we're going to spread the costs of these programmes over a longer time frame, reducing people's bill.\n\nAnd to make sure we carry on cutting enough carbon, the government will pay for new incentives for people to insulate their homes.\n\nAlongside the Green Deal, when you buy a new home, you could get up to £1000 from Government to spend on important energy-saving measures – equivalent to half the stamp duty on the average house – or even more for particularly expensive measures. It’s an all-round win: better insulation means cheaper bills; it’s how we cut carbon emissions; and it will boost British businesses who provide these services.\n\nOn top of that, we will offer cash incentives to landlords of the least energy-efficient properties so that when they are between tenants they can better insulate their properties – and we’ll also make sure our schools and hospitals are more energy-efficient too.\n\nTaken together, these things mean we will meet our green commitments and support those employed in the insulation industry, but crucially without putting the cost on energy customers.\n\nLabour have promised a temporary price freeze on energy bills. But they’re taking people for fools. Energy companies would hike up prices both before and after the freeze – so families would end up paying more. Not only that – by cutting investment in green energy, their freeze would threaten thousands of jobs. Labour’s con is the worst of all worlds. When an offer sounds too good to be true it usually is.\n\nThe Coalition has come up with a serious and credible plan that actually works.\n\nBy taking the time to get this right we’ve got the best outcome all round. No poor family will lose a penny of help. Our clean energy sector will get the investment it needs and the lights will stay on. We’ll cut just as much carbon as we planned. Instead of a fake giveaway, we’ve found another way to support Britain’s hard-pressed families when they need it most.","2013-12-01 08:02:19+00","653092548048400_691655960858725",1],[1237,"Our long-term plan for the economy is working.

I know many people are deeply concerned about the impact that could have on our country. I share those concerns.\n\nEver since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Britain has championed the case for bringing nations which languished behind the Iron Curtain into Nato and the EU. That is important to their prosperity and security – and ours. Britain has also been one of the strongest supporters of a single market. It is in our interests that it should grow, and for our citizens to have the opportunity to work in other European countries.\n\nBut things have gone wrong. Since 2004, we have witnessed the biggest migration in Europe outside wartime. In Britain’s case, 1m people from central and eastern Europe are now living here. So what lessons can be learned? There is the lesson on transitional controls. In 2004, the Labour government made the decision that the UK should opt out completely of transitional controls on the new EU member states. They had the right to impose a seven-year ban before new citizens could come and work here, but – almost alone in Europe – Labour refused it. That was a monumental mistake.\n\nThere is the lesson on income disparity. It was hardly surprising that with income per head in the joining countries around half of the EU average, so many people chose to come here. Yet when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, Labour had not learned the lesson. That was the moment to address difficult questions about when to allow new entrants full access to each other’s labour markets – but the Labour government ducked these questions. That is why this government extended transitional controls on Bulgaria and Romania from five to the maximum seven years.\n\nThe other major lesson was that failures in immigration policy were closely linked to welfare and education. If it does not pay to work, or if British people lack skills, that creates a huge space in our labour market for people from overseas to fill. You cannot blame people for wanting to come here and work hard; but the real answer lies in training our own people to fill these jobs. That is what this government is doing: providing record numbers of apprenticeships, demanding rigour in schools and building a welfare system that encourages work.\n\nBut of course people are most concerned with the action we are taking now. We are changing the rules so that no one can come to this country and expect to get out of work benefits immediately; we will not pay them for the first three months. If after three months an EU national needs benefits – we will no longer pay these indefinitely. They will only be able to claim for a maximum of six months unless they can prove they have a genuine prospect of employment.\n\nWe are also toughening up the test which migrants who want to claim benefits must undergo. This will include a new minimum earnings threshold. If they don’t pass that test, we will cut off access to benefits such as income support. Newly arrived EU jobseekers will not be able to claim housing benefit.\n\nIf people are not here to work – if they are begging or sleeping rough – they will be removed. They will then be barred from re-entry for 12 months, unless they can prove they have a proper reason to be here, such as a job. We are also clamping down on those who employ people below the minimum wage. They will pay the price with a fine of up to £20,000 for every underpaid employee – more than four times the fine today.\n\nBritain is not acting alone in taking these steps. Other countries such as the Netherlands already impose a three-month residence requirement before you can access benefits such as job seekers’ allowance. All this is what we can legally do within the limits of the treaties Labour signed up to. But finally, let me set out how my party is planning to prevent these problems arising in the future.\n\nThe EU of today is very different from the EU of 30 years ago. We need to face the fact that free movement has become a trigger for vast population movements caused by huge disparities in income. That is extracting talent out of countries that need to retain their best people and placing pressure on communities. It is time for a new settlement which recognises that free movement is a central principle of the EU, but it cannot be a completely unqualified one. We are not the only country to see free movement as a qualified right: interior ministers from Austria, Germany and the Netherlands have also said this to the European Commission.\n\nSo Britain, as part of our plan to reform the EU, will now work with others to return the concept of free movement to a more sensible basis.\n\nAnd we need to do the same with welfare. For example, free movement should not be about exporting child benefit – I want to work with our European partners to address this.\n\nBringing new countries in to give them peace and prosperity remains one of the EU’s greatest strengths. It will be many years, perhaps a decade, before another country joins. It cannot be done on the same basis as it was in the past. We must put in place new arrangements that will slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not cause vast migrations.\n\nThere are various ways we could achieve this. One would be to require a new country to reach a certain income or economic output per head before full free movement was allowed. Individual member states could be freed to impose a cap if their inflow from the EU reached a certain number in a single year.\n\nThe EU needs to change if it is to regain the trust of its peoples. I look forward to working with other countries who also want reform – and to putting the choice about our future in Europe in a referendum. If I am prime minister after the next election, the British people will have their say.","2013-11-27 10:12:04+00","653092548048400_689727907718197",1],[1244,"Delighted my constituent Phil Ball has been released on bail.

They are aspiration personified.\n\nI have nothing but respect for people who strike out on their own, build something from scratch then work day and night to make it a success.\n\nThese are the values we need in Britain today and they are national heroes.\n\nThat’s why Small Business Saturday matters. And it’s just as important that we keep up the momentum afterwards.\n\nThis Government is working flat out to do that.\n\nFirst, we’re making it easier to start a business, with Karren Brady leading the fight as our Conservative enterprise champion. We’re making it easier to get a bank loan through Funding for Lending.\n\nWe’re backing budding entrepreneurs with Start-Up Loans. And we’re helping people on benefits get back on their feet and start something of their own with our New Enterprise Allowance.\n\nSecond, we’re making it easier to grow a business, cutting the jobs tax so that from next April almost half a million firms will pay no National Insurance at all.\n\nThis helps traders with their bottom line and it’s a huge boost for jobs too.\n\nThird, we’re helping small businesses to sell their produce abroad.\n\nThis week I’m off to China on a trade trip and I’m packing the plane with 50 of Britain’s top small firms.\n\nThe label Made in Britain is something to be proud of and I want to see more of it in shops overseas.\n\nThis is all starting to work. In the past year we’ve seen more than 100,000 new business start-ups, the highest number in any year on record.\n\nOur economy is beginning to turn a corner but this is no time to be complacent.\n\nTogether we’ve got to back small businesses across Britain. That’s what next Saturday is all about – and that’s what this Government is about.","2013-11-27 11:28:09+00","653092548048400_689758667715121",1],[1243,"I'm celebrating the enterprise culture (and my favourite dish - Lamb Rogan) at the British Curry Awards","2013-11-25 22:16:36+00","653092548048400_689003284457326",1],[1245,"I'm supporting James Wharton's EU Referendum bill.\n\nJoin our campaign to #LetBritainDecide at http://www.letbritaindecide.com/","2013-11-22 09:41:46+00","653092548048400_687157694641885",1],[1247,"Great to meet so many inspiring young people at the Buckingham Palace Step Up To Serve event yesterday.\r\n\r\nFind out more about the campaign at http://www.stepuptoserve.org.uk/","2013-11-22 09:19:21+00","653092548048400_687151987975789",1],[1248,"Great to see Labour city leaders backing #HS2.

Read my article for The Sun on why it's key to my plan for Britain:\n\nJUST over a month ago I told Sun readers about the launch of Help to Buy.\n\nThis is the Conservative policy that makes it easier for people to get a mortgage and buy a house — cutting the deposits they have to put down.\n\nToday I can tell you that it is delivering. Just four weeks in, here are the figures you need to know.\n\n- One: Over 2,000 people have been accepted in principle for a Help to Buy mortgage — and put in offers.\n\nPut it another way, every single day in the past month, 75 families have been put on the path to owning their dream home. This is working — some people have even got the keys already.\n\n- Two: £365million worth of mortgage applications are being processed. Those are home sales that may never have happened — with all that construction work, furniture shopping and extra jobs.\n\n- Three: This is not just cutting deposits, it’s cutting mortgage bills. A mortgage for a Help to Buy property at average price is £2,500 a year cheaper.\n\n- Four: This is helping unlock housebuilding — there are a third more houses being built now compared to last year.\n\nBut the best thing about Help to Buy isn’t these headline statistics. It’s who is benefiting from it. When we launched Help to Buy we heard a lot of scare stories about how this would be a policy for the rich, the South East, the elderly and those who already had homes.\n\nOne month in and the figures show this is nonsense. The typical house bought with Help to Buy is just over £160,000 — well below the national average. It’s proving hugely popular across the country, with three quarters of applications outside London and the South East.\n\nAnd what’s more, most applicants are first-time buyers, young and have an average household income.\n\nIn short, Help to Buy is helping those people who I always knew it would — the people I’ve had front and centre in my mind from the start. It’s helping people like you, Sun readers.\n\nIt’s helping hardworking people in our country who want to get on in life. Responsible people who work hard, put in the hours and can afford a mortgage — but can’t afford sky-high deposits.\n\nPeople like Kayleigh and Chris who I met a few weeks back. They both had good jobs, and had saved for several years, but still they couldn’t afford the deposit for a house. Now with Help to Buy, they are looking forward to their first Christmas together in their new home.\n\nUnbelievably, there are people who actually oppose Help to Buy and don’t want people like Kayleigh and Chris to get on. I’ll let you guess who they are. Yes, the same old Labour party. The party that oversaw the biggest boom and the biggest bust; the party who did nothing to help young people get on the property ladder; the party who saw housebuilding collapse to its lowest level since the 1920s. The party who just don’t get aspiration like the Conservatives do.\n\nConservatives understand that owning a home is about more than bricks and mortar. It’s about moving on and moving up, having something to pass on to your children, independence and self-reliance.\n\nAbove all, it’s about aspiration. That’s why the party of Right to Buy in the Eighties is the party of Help to Buy this decade.\n\nAnd it’s why Help to Buy will always be a key part of my plan for Britain.\n\nhttp://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/5255519/2000-get-homes-with-new-help-to-buy-scheme.html","2013-11-11 09:15:54+00","653092548048400_680700578620930",1],[1273,"I'm supporting James Wharton's EU Referendum Bill - you can sign up to join me at http://www.letbritaindecide.com/","2013-11-08 11:01:03+00","653092548048400_679447602079561",1],[1274,"The 26 hour cricket net that I took part in for Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation has been confirmed as a Guinness World Record!
