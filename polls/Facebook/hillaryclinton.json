We need to give more support to students who are also parents. So, here's a new plan: We're going to create a scholarship program for student parents, called SPARK—Student Parents in America Raising Kids. It will give extra financial help for student parents who keep their grades up. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to help pay for gas or a babysitter—just the kind of extra help that can keep somebody in school. \n\nWe're also going to significantly increase access to quality childcare on college campuses. Childcare centers already exist on some campuses, but a lot of parents don't have any safe, affordable place to leave their kids while they go to school. \n\nThe financial benefits of all this are clear: Students with college degrees can earn more than a half a million dollars over their lifetimes more than students with high school degrees. When a parent is able to get that education that so many parents work for, it really makes a difference. This is going to be good for kids, for students, and for parents.

The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate, but the thinking, and the attitude, toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten. \n\nSo yes, it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive, outrageous, pick your adjective.
