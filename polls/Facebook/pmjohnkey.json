With this address he is now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists, even as he proclaims “America first,” he puts K Street lobbyists first. He is never going to fight the system, he is the system. He and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. She has made her millions from inside and Donald Trump has made his billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. Both are part of the culture of foreign policy for personal gain.","2016-04-27 19:14:25+00","69983322463_10154090111692464",1],[61,"It’s been 48 days since the last #GOPDebate.\n\nIndiana deserves a debate, Donald J.

In 1979, upon his arrival, he kissed the tarmac. And the dust that had all but covered the churches ruptured as the bells rang out – one after another. Soon millions of people lined the streets. And when Saint John Paul II addressed the crowds before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he spoke these immortal words: ‘On how many battlefields has that solider given witness to the rights of man, indelibly inscribed in the inviolable rights of the people, by falling for \"our freedom and yours!\"\n\nAnd he asked for the Lord’s blessing upon the land:\n\n\"Let your Spirit descend.\nAnd renew the face of the earth,\nthe face of this land.\"\n\nThat is the redemption message. By His sacrifice we are made new. And as we remember the gift of salvation on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, let us be so bold to ask the same. We face a different enemy than in 1979 – but one with the same goal – to snuff out the light of freedom.

A so-called ‘moderate’ Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make – someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor. Make no mistake, if Garland were confirmed, he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment, legalizing partial-birth abortion, and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS. We cannot afford to lose the Supreme Court for generations to come by nominating or confirming someone that a dealmaker like Donald Trump would support. Washington dealmakers cannot be trusted with such crucial lifetime appointments.\n\nI proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief – our advice and consent – that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office. The People will decide. I commend Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley for holding the line and ensuring that We the People get to exercise our authority to decide the direction of the Supreme Court and the Bill of Rights.","2016-03-16 18:27:12+00","69983322463_10153969933292464",1],[406,"#DuckingDonald strikes again.

She was her husband’s first friend and counselor – and his inspiration. In her public role as first lady, she brought elegance, dignity, and wisdom to the White House as she so graciously hosted dignitaries from around the world. She also poured her life into helping the afflicted, especially those gripped by drug and alcohol addition. She pioneered programs to lift Americans out of addiction and restore hope to them and their families.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, her faithfulness only multiplied as she stayed by his side. She always remained the love of his life, and after his passing she carried on his legacy – and most of all his faith that this nation would always stand for good in the face of evil, defeat those who meant her harm, and remain a shining city upon a hill.\n\nToday, Heidi and I mourn with the Reagan family, and we lift up prayers of gratitude for the many years of devotion Nancy gave to her husband and her country. We remember especially how dedicated she was to preserving the memories of her husband. She will be deeply missed. And we feel the sorrow of the nation. But we remember too that like her husband Nancy was a person of faith. Ronald Reagan said once he could not “imagine life without her.” It is good that they are together again.","2016-03-06 19:49:04+00","69983322463_10153939412562464",1],[497,"\"Today Ted Cruz dominated in Kansas.

Well, actually, that’s where for many of us this began. We believe that 2016 isn’t simply another election year. It’s a chance to change the course of this nation: To once again have the courage to stand up to our enemies, to call them by their name, and to defeat ISIS. To restore every citizens’ God-given liberties, especially their right to live in accordance with their faith. And to ignite jobs and growth so that families can once again have confidence that our children will have greater opportunities than we had.\n\nThat’s why hundreds of thousands of supporters and volunteers have risen up across this country. And I believe, that’s why there is incredible optimism for 2016. It’s the last year of the Obama Administration.

And I will shut down the broken immigration system that is letting jihadists into our country.\n\nNothing President Obama said tonight will assist in either case.","2015-12-07 02:20:01+00","69983322463_10153743968507464",1],[749,"The recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino have further confirmed that radical Islamic terrorists are at war with the West. The attack in San Bernardino was the worst Islamic terrorist attack on American soil since the attack on Ft. Hood in my home state of Texas.\n\nAt the time of that attack, the President insisted that it was a case of “workplace violence” ignoring the clear evidence that it was a terrorist attack. I was proud to have been able to help ensure that each of the victims of the Ft. Hood attack finally received a Purple Heart for their sacrifice.\n\nThe reality is that what President Obama, Secretary Kerry and Hillary Clinton have done has not worked. Their policies have in fact made the world more dangerous. It is time for a dramatic shift in both foreign and national security policy.\n\nTonight when President Obama addresses the nation, I hope that he will acknowledge and take responsibility for the failed policies of his administration and will take concrete steps to reverse the damage done.\n\nHe should start by finally calling our enemy by its name. Denying who the enemy is will only delay their defeat. The terrorists call themselves the Islamic State. So tonight, I challenge President Obama to finally acknowledge the enemy that the United States and our allies face. It is radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nSecond, after naming our enemy, the President should lay out a bold strategy to defeat ISIS, not to try to change the subject to gun control or the compliant media headline to global warming, but rather lay out a plan for decisive action for victory over evil.\n\nThird, Americans want to know how this administration intends to keep them safe here at home. Border security is national security. We can no longer accept a border that is not secure and the President should announce the immediate steps he will take to ensure that it is.\n\nWe now know that one of the attackers was here on a visa. She went through the same background checks that the President says the refugees from Syria will go through. We also know that ISIS has made it clear that they intend to infiltrate the refugees in order to get to the United States. That can’t happen.\n\nThe President should place an immediate moratorium on refugees from countries with a significant al Qaeda or ISIS presence, such as Syria. I’ve introduced legislation to make this happen; it is not a desired step, but a necessary step for the security of the United States.\n\nFinally, the President should resist using terrorist attacks to try to take away the rights of law-abiding Americans. Millions of Americans have chosen to protect themselves and their families by purchasing a firearm. This is their right; indeed protecting their families is their obligation. The President should be looking to stop those who would do us harm – not attempting to take away the constitutional liberties of millions of innocent Americans.\n\nThe American people know that the threat is very real. They will be looking for the President to address restoring America’s role in the world, defeating ISIS, securing the border, and keeping them safe from radical Islamic terrorism here at home.\n\nThey want to know the specific steps the President intends to take to keep them safe.\n\nWe need American leadership, and we need America winning again. The world does as well.\n\nI look forward to the President’s remarks.","2015-12-07 00:28:31+00","69983322463_10153743725147464",1],[788,"#CruzCrew: Don't miss out on the chance to save 20% at http://store.tedcruz.org with our #CyberMonday sale!","2015-11-30 18:05:38+00","69983322463_10153732040712464",1],[5848,"","2014-06-10 08:13:13+00","12635800428_10152507382775429",2],[722,"We need a president who will stand up and unequivocally defend the national security interests of this country!\n\nMiss my speech at The Heritage Foundation live?

On this holiday, we remember the miracle that enabled a freedom-loving people – led by the heroic Maccabees – to defeat the oppressive dictator Antiochus so that they could once again freely worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the eight days of Chanukah, the Jewish people commemorate their liberation from oppression and the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. As the Talmud teaches, God delivered ‘many into the hands of the few, strong into the hands of the weak, and evildoers into the hands of the righteous.’\n\nToday, the Jewish people, together with freedom-loving people around the world, once again find their religious faith and liberty under attack from radical forces of oppression and intolerance. Whether it is the BDS movement on college campuses, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, or radical Islamic terror in Israel and around the world, we need modern-day Maccabees to stand together and push back against the forces of evil. As a nation founded by a people seeking religious liberty, America stands with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in protecting the light of faith and liberty.\n\nThe victory of the people of Israel is a testament to God’s providence. On these nights when Jewish families around the country and the world celebrate with latkes, lighting the menorah, and playing dreidel, Heidi and I join with you to recognize, ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Sham,’ a great miracle happened there.

For the police officers, firefighters, and first responders who protect our communities. And for the pastors, teachers, and parents who guide us to know the truth, and be set free by it.\n\nAnd we remember President George Washington’s call in the first Thanksgiving Day Proclamation, 226 years ago, to \"unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations, and beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions… to render our National Government a blessing to all the people… and to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue.\"\n\nIt is this hope in a Higher Ruler that inspired the Pilgrims to leave everything in pursuit of freedom, and it is this same Providence that, if we call upon the name of the Lord, will restore the promise of America.","2015-11-26 14:27:13+00","69983322463_10153724760487464",1],[805,"Tomorrow and every day, don't forget to say a prayer of Thanksgiving for our men and women in uniform spending the holiday away from home.","2015-11-26 00:32:21+00","69983322463_10153723780102464",1],[806,"Welcome to Houston, Mario Lopez!

This is an evil that does not discriminate between French, German or American, Christian, Muslim or Jew, soldier, football player, or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious, totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies, and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary.\n\nWe must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS’ ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris, we need to take immediate, commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means.\n\nSuch steps, however, are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America—that it is, in effect, signing your own death warrant.","2015-11-14 02:08:13+00","69983322463_10153702166812464",1],[873,"Horrific reports coming out of Paris.

A few days later, another Jewish family was walking in the Old City of Jerusalem after praying at the Western Wall when a Palestinian terrorist went on a stabbing attack. He murdered the father along with another courageous man who rushed to the scene to the family’s aid. Both men leave behind their wives and nine children. In addition to the four murdered, many more Israelis have been seriously wounded from car-ramming, rock-throwing, and brutal knife and screwdriver stabbing attacks in what appears to be a fresh horror—an epidemic of low-tech, brutal attacks by militants who are acting on their own initiative.\n\nThese attacks have been incubated by the continued incitement and glorification of violence by the Palestinian leadership, most recently by President Mahmoud Abbas during his address at the United Nations General Assembly. He still has yet to categorically condemn these attacks. It is long past time for the United States and the international community to hold the Palestinians accountable for their incitement and support for terrorism, including through the financial payment to Palestinian terrorists who are jailed in Israel for committing acts of terrorism.\n\nIn yet another stark reminder of how closely our nations are connected in this fight, the father murdered last Thursday, Eitam Henkin, was a dual Israeli-American citizen. The terrorist who killed him did not care, as his sole intent was to kill Jews, not to engage in a political process. There is no moral equivalence between Palestinian terrorism and the obligation of Israel to act in defense of its people. To the Israeli people, especially those who are victims of terrorism and their families: I proudly stand in solidarity with you during this challenging time.","2015-10-09 22:04:28+00","69983322463_10153638995517464",1],[1119,"The Obama Administration has been caught flat-footed as Putin's actions threaten to inflame and destabilize an already acute crisis.\n \nEnough already.

The worst terrorist attack on our homeland taught us two things: that our oceans would not protect us from a determined enemy in the 21st century, and that radical Islamic terrorism was not a regional annoyance with limited capacity, but a real and present danger to our very way of life.\n\nToday, we remember the victims: the people in the twin towers of the World Trade Center, that emblem of America’s economic power, and the first responders who charged in to save them. The military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon working to keep our country safe. The innocent passengers on those four doomed flights, some of whom heroically sacrificed themselves to minimize the casualties on the ground.\n\nBut as we pause in their honor, we must also look forward. The hard fact of the matter is that today, we again face a gathering threat from radical Islamists who may have changed their name or affiliation, but who are unchanged in their determination to degrade, and ultimately destroy, the West.\n\nToday, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism is still very much as real as it was fourteen years ago. From Nidal Hassan yelling ‘Allahu Akbar’ before he murdered fourteen innocent people in Ft. Hood, Texas, to the Boston marathon bombings, a beheading in Oklahoma, and the attack in Chattanooga that left four marines and a sailor dead.\n\nSeptember 11th, 2015 should be more than a day of reflection and remembrance.

The blame should be laid squarely at the door of the vicious, radical Islamism that is tearing communities apart from Libya to Syria and Iraq, creating the terrible circumstances that are causing the migrants to flee their homes.

Under the terms of this deal, Iran will retain all of its centrifuges, one-third of which will continue to spin. Rather than the most intrusive inspections regime in history that we were promised, IAEA inspectors must petition the mullahs to visit sensitive sites, and wait for two weeks for their permission. In a final, shocking concession, the United States will support lifting of the United Nations arms embargos that restrict the Iranian ballistic missile program and arms trafficking. And in return, billions of dollars of economic relief will flow to Tehran.\n\nYet, in his remarks this morning, the President glossed over the truth about Iran’s world-leading state-sponsorship of terrorism that is violently destabilizing the region, and would grow more deadly should the Iranians get a nuclear bomb. He failed to mention American citizens, Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati and Jason Rezaian, who continue to languish in Iranian prisons or Robert Levinson, who is still unaccounted for. For them, today is no ‘opportunity to move in a new direction’ as the President claimed. We owe it to our fellow Americans elevate, not ignore, their plight, to demand their swift and unconditional release by the implacably hostile regime that holds them.\n\nEven by the low standards of the Joint Plan of Action, this is a staggeringly bad deal. It is a fundamental betrayal of the security of the United States and of our closest allies, first and foremost Israel.\n\nBut thankfully, it is not a done deal. We still have an opportunity to tell the truth about what Prime Minister Netanyahu called today a \"bad mistake of historic proportion.\"\n\nCongress will have 60 days to review it, and the American people will have 60 days to tell their elected representatives just what they think of it. I urge all my fellow citizens to speak out and let their elected leaders know that even if President Obama won’t see it, we know the leaders of the Islamic Republic who lead crowds in chants of \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\" are not our partners in peace, and must not be put on the path to a nuclear bomb.","2015-07-14 15:13:38+00","69983322463_10153438940672464",1],[1685,"Unconscionable: Tehran has held Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian for almost a year.

Today I am calling upon former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose leadership this bad deal began, and other Presidential candidates to join me in demanding that Secretary Kerry stop negotiating with this hostile and violent enemy of America and immediately leave Vienna.\n\nWe are now on the eve of what is by my count the fifth \"deadline\" for a comprehensive nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is still unclear if this arbitrary date will be more respected than any of its predecessors, but it hardly matters at this point. By any metric, the negotiations have failed—at least from the perspective of America’s national security. All of our key priorities—stopping enrichment of uranium, removing stockpiles of enriched uranium, and exposing and eradicating the potential military applications of Iran’s nuclear program—have been ceded to the Iranians.\n\nPerhaps there was some hope for this process two years ago when Hasan Rouhani became president of Iran. Given Iran’s dire economic circumstances caused by the unprecedented program of international sanctions, we could have demanded concessions from the mullahs before any negotiations took place–notably the release of all Americans unjustly held in Iran and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. Once negotiations began, we could have made it clear the above conditions would have to be met before sanctions relief. And rather than stove-piping Iran’s nuclear program from its abysmal human rights record, aggressive state sponsorship of terrorism and ballistic missile program–the only purpose of which is to deliver a nuclear weapon–we should have insisted these issues be addressed to our satisfaction as well.\n\nUnfortunately, in their unseemly eagerness to make a deal, President Obama and Secretary Kerry have squandered all our advantages and ceded all our priorities. There is no possibility for an acceptable agreement at this point because there is no incentive for the Iranians to make one. Our first priority must be to end this farce; the best we can do is cut our losses.","2015-07-06 23:36:09+00","69983322463_10153421910912464",1],[1714,"Thank you for your tremendous support, #CruzCrew!","2015-07-06 18:11:21+00","69983322463_10153421172602464",1],[1715,"Help us lead the fight for a #FullRepeal of Obamacare: http://bit.ly/1HHvW4W","2015-07-06 14:44:31+00","69983322463_10153420633752464",1],[1716,"I’ll be in West Des Moines a little later today, Monday, July 6, and I’d like to see you there!\n\nBarnes and Noble\n1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n4550 University Avenue\nWest Des Moines, IA 50266\n\nHope you'll join us and bring a friend!","2015-07-06 12:36:49+00","69983322463_10153420383032464",1],[1720,"Great question, Jeff!

But I don’t believe that. Everywhere I go, I see it in their faces and hear it in their voices. Americans want to believe again.\n\nOn this July 4th, I want to share with you my hope for America.\n\nIn the summer of 1776, Patriots gathered to dissolve the political bonds they had with England and declare their independence. The bold call for independence presupposed that the colonists were equal in station to the British Empire. They listed their grievances as justification for the split.\n\nThe fifty-six signers from the thirteen colonies affixed their signatures to the document. It could only mean one thing – war. Indeed, the American Revolution came.\n\nToday, we live out the Founder’s promise to America – that a free people pursuing their dreams would lead to limitless possibilities.\n\nMy father came to America from Cuba in 1957. He had very little money, and spoke little English. My Irish-Italian mother was the daughter of working class parents. Both my parents worked hard and were the first to graduate from college. In a single generation, their son became a United States Senator and now I am running for President of the United States.

In 2008, despite having done nothing to merit it, the Hermit Kingdom was removed from the list in the hopes that the concession would bring them to the negotiating table. Seven years later, an emboldened North Korea has become more dangerous – testing nuclear weapons, engaging in clandestine nuclear programs with Iran, launching cyber attacks against America, and most recently, threatening our homeland with a nuclear weapon. Furthermore, North Korea was intercepted in 2013 trafficking weapons from none other than Cuba.\n\nThe State Sponsors of Terrorism list is not a bargaining tool. It is a tool to measure the bad behavior of hostile regimes and hold them accountable for it. But the Obama Administration seems to want an embassy in Havana more than they want to do the hard work of securing the American people.\n\nThis dangerous recklessness must stop.

At the behest of those seeking to use unelected judges to strike down democratically enacted marriage laws, courts across the country have seized for themselves the authority to redefine marriage. Today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases raising the question of whether such judicial intrusion is constitutionally proper. It is not.\n\nFor millennia, the union of a man and a woman has been the fundamental building block of society, and the Judeo-Christian value of traditional marriage is a cornerstone upon which the strength of our Nation rests. Before 2004, no U.S. state recognized same-sex marriages. And to preserve the traditional understanding of marriage, thirty states have amended their state constitutions to define marriage as between one man and one woman, and in total over forty states have passed laws or amendments to protect traditional marriage.\n\nThis effort to redefine marriage by judicial fiat poses a serious threat to the religious liberty for those who embrace traditional marriage. We are seeing businesses shut down and individuals threatened with costly lawsuits simply because they do not agree with same-sex marriage. There was a time when the defense of religious liberty was an issue of bipartisan agreement. Yet now the progressive left is seeking to force their view of marriage upon all Americans, regardless of their religious convictions.\n\nResorting to federal courts to further that effort is unconstitutional. Under our Constitution, courts do not make law. This is why I am proud to have filed an amicus brief in support of the right of states to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. It is my sincere hope that the Justices of the highest court of our land will rule on the side of the U.S. Constitution and let the people, through their elected State representatives, continue to define marriage as it has been understood since the beginning of time.\n\nIn case that does not happen, I have also introduced legislation and a constitutional amendment in the Senate last week to prevent federal courts from further interfering with any state’s Constitutionally-protected authority to define marriage.","2015-04-28 20:50:57+00","69983322463_10153255156987464",1],[1979,"Today 85,000 Baltimore city children will not be going to school.

But rioting and mayhem are not the answer.\n\nWhile we continue to pray for a peaceful conclusion to the events in Baltimore–and pray for the families of those injured–I hope we all remember that our nation’s law enforcement consists of thousands of heroic officers who deeply respect the dignity of each person they serve to protect. Targeting law enforcement for violence is wrong, and it cannot be allowed to persist.\n\nLikewise, the small number of those who have wreaked destruction upon Baltimore over the past few days are not emblematic of the thousands of honest, hard-working families who are proud to call the city home.\n\nThere is, and has always been, far more to celebrate in America than to worry about.

This year, on top of the frustrating reminder that Americans are giving too much of their income to fund too many wasteful government programs, families are now being forced to pay the Obamacare tax for the first time.\n\nInstead of government-run healthcare that increases taxes, limits options, and puts the government between patients and their doctors, imagine a free-market system that enables healthcare to be personal, portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets Americans fill out their taxes on a postcard. Imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the IRS.\n\nMore of Americans’ hard-earned wages should be able to stay in their wallets so they can be free to invest more in their families and businesses, not in growing big government.\n\nTax reform is crucial to reversing our current economic stagnation, sparking economic growth, and expanding opportunity. I’m running for President because I believe that together, we can make D.C. listen, we can repeal Obamacare, we can implement fundamental tax reform, and we can restore our nation as a place that champions prosperity and opportunity for all.","2015-04-15 17:01:56+00","69983322463_10153220808207464",1],[2012,"When it comes to making any deals with world dictators, the President of the United States should use two words: Prove it.

Toxic gasses filled the air; planes swooped below; and machine guns buzzed well into the night. In the first two days, the Division lost roughly 1,600 men. But they kept fighting, held the line, and captured over 600 enemy soldiers. The Texas troops forced the Germans to concede a primary stronghold, which proved to be a critical step in winning the war.\n\nA month later, on November 11, 1918, Germany signed an armistice ending the Great War, and ever since we have commemorated our veterans on this day.\n\nEach person who serves in the Armed Forces deserves our utmost gratitude – they pledge their lives so that we might remain free. Today we honor them.\n\nTexans have always been proud of our troops who, like those who charged the dark forest of Blanc Mont Ridge, defend liberty in the most harrowing circumstances.\n\nJust shy of a century since that most fateful night, the men and women of Texas continue to serve with great courage and commitment.\n\nNinety Texans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the United States’ highest recognition of personal bravery. Thousands have volunteered to defend our nation since 9-11, and hundreds have given their lives in the war against terrorism. In the past year, over 17,500 Texans have joined the Armed Forces. With over 200,000 active duty personnel, reservists, National Guardsmen, and civilians at 15 military institutions across the state, Texans play a critical role in keeping Americans safe and free.\n\nToday, service members from Dyess Air Force base are conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets. ISIS is the face of evil. It is persecuting Christians. It is beheading children. It is pillaging towns. And Dyess Air Force base is playing a critical role in exterminating this evil.\n\nToday, troops from Fort Bliss and Fort Hood are deploying to Africa and fighting the spread of what Texans have unfortunately already witnessed to be the deadly disease of Ebola. These soldiers are going into the thick of the epidemic and risking their own wellbeing to end this outbreak. We are grateful for their swift response.\n\nToday, the Texas National Guard has stepped up to secure the border and protect citizens from dangerous illegal criminals that only perpetuate the humanitarian crisis on the border. They are on the front lines of saving lives on American soil. In one case, just over a month ago, three National Guard soldiers rescued a Texan who was injured along the river. He was bleeding profusely, but with their swift response, he survived and has recovered.\n\nToday, bases from Shepperd to Goodfellow to Camp Bullis train our next generation of pilots, medics, and ground troops. Bases scattered throughout the state ensure that the future of our military is strong, and that the young men and women who pledge their lives to defend this nation are well-trained and equipped. These training programs provide them a future of service and opportunity, and in turn, these young soldiers safeguard our national security interests.\n\nToday we recognize a life-long Texan, Richard Overton, who at 108 is the oldest living American World War Two veteran – we thank him for his continued patriotism.\n\nThese are only a handful of examples highlighting the robust military presence in the Lone Star State. There are countless told and untold stories of the heroes in the state. Let us never forget to tell them.\n\nThis spirit of courage lives on in Texas, and it is with grateful hearts that today we say thank you to all the men and women who have served our country. So today, take a minute to call a service member you know or shake the hand of a veteran. Thank them for their sacrifice. It’s an honor to know them. And let us never forget the price they pay so that we may enjoy the many blessings of liberty.","2014-11-11 15:08:38+00","69983322463_10152840498897464",1],[2249,"\"Net neutrality\" is the biggest regulatory threat to the Internet and will lead to fewer choices, fewer opportunities, and higher prices for consumers.","2014-11-11 00:08:27+00","69983322463_10152839355922464",1],[7267,"John Key - Video Journal No.1 for 2012","2012-01-26 00:54:32+00","12635800428_274584472607950",2],[2189,"20-year Houston Astros veteran Craig Biggio was just voted into the MLB Hall of Fame.

Instead, Majority Leader Harry Reid is holding a series of votes today for the sheer purpose of blocking that vote on Obama's amnesty.\n\nHarry Reid's last act as Majority Leader is to, once again, act as an enabler for President Obama, by blocking this vote on the President's amnesty. He is going to an embarrassing length to tie up the floor to obstruct debate and a vote on this issue because he knows amnesty is unpopular with the American people, and he doesn't want the Democrats on the record as supporting it.\n\nNo one wants a government shutdown. We are only seeking a vote. As soon as the Majority Leader allows a vote on a measure to stop President Obama's amnesty, we can and should move forward on this bill to fund the government.

But in Iran, an oppressive regime is inciting hatred against us as thousands chant “Death to America” as today is the 35th anniversary of when Iranian militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages for 444 days. This is the difference between America and Iran. Here we celebrate freedom; there they openly declare their desire to take it away from us.\n\nFor 35 years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been our enemy.  They have sponsored terrorist attacks that have murdered our citizens. They have threatened both the United States and our ally Israel with annihilation.  Every year on “Death to America Day” they declare this goal openly.  Yet right now the Obama Administration is desperately trying to compromise with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, which I fear could be a historic mistake.\n\nPlease vote today.  It matters who we elect.\n\nOur nation needs a new generation of leaders who will champion America at every turn by defending our interests on the world stage and standing up to those who wish us harm.\n\nRemember what happened hours after a strong conservative Republican was sworn into office in January 1980. The American hostages were freed.\n\nToday we have the chance to take back control of the Senate. A strong Republican Congress can apply more pressure to stop the Obama Administration from striking a bad deal with Iran.\n\nAnd then, when Republicans win the White House in 2016, America will once again send the mullahs in Tehran an unmistakable signal that we will not tolerate their aggression and insults any more.","2014-11-04 17:20:13+00","69983322463_10152827179322464",1],[2269,"SD 10, Konni Burton needs your vote!","2014-11-04 15:15:46+00","69983322463_10152827004792464",1],[2271,"It's Election Day!

By refusing to rule if the States can define marriage, the Supreme Court is abdicating its duty to uphold the Constitution. The fact that the Supreme Court Justices, without providing any explanation whatsoever, have permitted lower courts to strike down so many state marriage laws is astonishing.\n\nThis is judicial activism at its worst. The Constitution entrusts state legislatures, elected by the People, to define marriage consistent with the values and mores of their citizens. Unelected judges should not be imposing their policy preferences to subvert the considered judgments of democratically elected legislatures.\n\nThe Supreme Court is, de facto, applying an extremely broad interpretation to the 14th Amendment without saying a word – an action that is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Because of the Court’s decision today, 11 States will likely now be forced to legalize same-sex marriage: Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. And this action paves the way for laws prohibiting same-sex marriage to be overturned in any state.\n\nIt is beyond dispute that when the 14th Amendment was adopted 146 years ago, as a necessary post-Civil War era reform, it was not imagined to also mandate same-sex marriage, but that is what the Supreme Court is implying today. The Court is making the preposterous assumption that the People of the United States somehow silently redefined marriage in 1868 when they ratified the 14th Amendment.\n\nNothing in the text, logic, structure, or original understanding of the 14th Amendment or any other constitutional provision authorizes judges to redefine marriage for the Nation. It is for the elected representatives of the People to make the laws of marriage, acting on the basis of their own constitutional authority, and protecting it, if necessary, from usurpation by the courts.\n\nMarriage is a question for the States. That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 2024, to protect the authority of state legislatures to define marriage. And that is why, when Congress returns to session, I will be introducing a constitutional amendment to prevent the federal government or the courts from attacking or striking down state marriage laws. \n\nTraditional marriage is an institution whose integrity and vitality are critical to the health of any society. We should remain faithful to our moral heritage and never hesitate to defend it.","2014-10-06 23:15:07+00","69983322463_10152761543252464",1],[2349,"Embracing the Great American Energy Renaissance empowered Texas to set record-breaking export numbers.

We perform different tasks, but the spirit is the same. We are proud of work and ashamed of idleness.  With us there is no task which is menial, no service which is degrading. All work is ennobling and all workers are ennobled.\"\n\nToday, too many Americans who want work are deprived of that opportunity.\n\nThe nominal unemployment rate is 6.2%.\n\nThe number of unemployed is 9.7 million.\n\nThe number of Americans who want work but have stopped looking is 2.2 million, and the number of discouraged Americans who have given up looking for work is 741,000.\n\nThe number of underemployed Americans is 19.4 million.  These are people who are unemployed (9.7 million), want work but have stopped searching for a job (2.2 million), or are working part time because they cannot find full time employment (7.5 million).\n\nThe labor force participation rate is 62.9 percent--the lowest level of participation since 1978.\n\nThe number of Americans not in the labor force is still over 92 million Americans, as 11,472,000 million Americans have left the workforce since President Obama took office.\n\nThese are not mere statistics—these represent real people, real families, people who have had their hopes and dreams crushed by a President and Democrats in Congress whose faith in Progressive politics will not be changed by the facts—their economic policies are a failure.\n\nWe can grow our way out of this problem. Ronald Reagan helped us do it in the 1980s and we can to it again now.\n\nIf the economy had recovered at the pace of Reagan’s recovery the  economy would be $2.2 trillion larger this year.  It's all because he put his faith in America's workers to make their own decisions that unleashed a new era of prosperity for the nation.\n\nPresident Obama has done the opposite and because of destructive Obama  policies, the economy has lost $6.4 trillion cumulatively since the recession ended--$20,388 per person.\n\nWe owe it to the American people to get the economy going again.  Many look for some silver bullet or innovative policy proposal, but it all goes to one basic question: Whom do you trust more, the the government, or the workers?\n\nI trust the workers. The American worker is what has made our nation the envy of the world. American workers create jobs, growth, and opportunities for themselves and the next generation. And, it is the American worker who deserves our confidence, support, and respect once again.","2014-09-01 13:10:46+00","69983322463_10152679754147464",1],[2432,"Watch the full speech from Americans for Prosperity's #Dream14 Summit here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j79QeW20APQ","2014-08-31 17:30:59+00","69983322463_10152677846147464",1],[2433,"Here we go at Americans for Prosperity's #Dream14 Summit!\n\nCouldn't catch it live?

Those men signified to the world that, although they yearned for peace, they would not submit to despots. Their demand for liberty offered no compromise.\n\nAs Thomas Jefferson later wrote, the Declaration was “an expression of the American mind”—one that refuses to accept insufferable evil, abuses, and usurpations and holds the freedom of its people supreme.\n\nThis is the spirit America was founded upon.\n\nThis is the heritage we all share.\n\nThis is what makes us Americans.\n\nMuch time has passed, but many of the challenges our forefathers faced have not changed. One doesn’t have to look very far on the world map to find nations where people suffer under brutal oppressors.\n\n“Terrorism” is an often-used word because the maiming and killing of innocents is so frequent. Suicide bombings, IEDs, mass killings, kidnappings, and hijackings are tools of their trade.\n\nHamas recently kidnapped and murdered three Jewish teenagers who were waiting for a bus to get home from school. They committed no wrong; they were targeted, forcibly taken, and shot.\n\nHundreds of girls remain missing in Nigeria, kidnapped by the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram.\n\nWe remember when Taliban forces shot Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenager because she was campaigning for girls' education. Courageously, she continues to advocate for it today.\n\nWe remember watching Neda Agha-Solten perish on the streets of Tehran during anti-government protests from a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nWe remember when the Syrian government gassed hundreds of beautiful, faultless, cherished children in their sleep last year, shocking the conscience of people around the world.\n\nAnd, there are countless others whose stories have not been told.\n\nMost of us, because we are Americans, will never have to suffer as these people and their families have. Thank God for the blessing of being an American and those who have fought and continue to fight to keep us free.\n\nAnd, remember, those Americans who are trapped, at this moment, in dark corners of the world.\n\nPastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, has been brutalized and remains imprisoned in Iran for merely sharing his Christian faith. Another American citizen, Kenneth Bae, is imprisoned in North Korea for also sharing his Christian faith. And, Meriam Ibrahim, a young mother who was forced to give birth with her legs in irons because she would not renounce her Christian faith, was kept in a Sudanese prison with her two small American children. Due to international outcry over their plight, they are finally out of jail, but are still waiting to experience real freedom in America.\n\nWe should never take our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for granted. Too much of the world does not recognize them.

Its basic premise—that those in power must obey the law—is the foundation for constitutional liberty. Magna Carta said that a King is subject to the law, that he must abide by the law, that he cannot arbitrarily change the law by his own will, and that he is required to faithfully execute the law.\n\nThis hundreds of years old pact between England’s rulers and subjects is particularly meaningful now, as an increasingly imperial President has threatened our own freedoms.  For even though America’s most powerful documents--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights--have direct lineage to Magna Carta many of our nation’s leaders no longer seem to respect it.\n\nToday, let us pledge to support leaders who will revere these extraordinary documents and once again honor the rule of law.  It the difference between the success of nations and the fall of nations. History shows us that whenever animating principles of Magna Carta are celebrated freedom thrives; whenever they are disregarded tyranny rises.\n\nToday, on the 799th anniversary of Magna Carta, let us raise up our voices to demand our leaders fulfill the promise Magna Carta made so long ago.","2014-06-15 19:05:54+00","69983322463_10152504723697464",1],[2601,"This headline gets it right: \n\nDid The IRS Really Lose Lois Lerner's Emails?

There is no safer place than in your mother's arms.  \n\nMy Mom, Eleanor Darragh, is a woman of incredible strength, independence, and compassion.  She fought her father, a difficult man who didn't believe women should be educated, to become the first person in her family to get a college education.  She stood up to him, and graduated from Rice in 1956 with a degree in math.  She went to work at Shell as a computer programmer in the 1950s, blazing an independent path.\n\nEvery day, she has been there for me.  She's been a best friend all my life.  She's peaceful, loving, and never judgmental.  She's a prayer warrior, lifting us up every single day.  And she loves unconditionally.  \n\nNo image makes me happier than seeing our girls Caroline and Catherine leaping through the air to land in her lap.

I cannot breathe without you.\"\n\nCaroline and Catherine adore their Mommy.  Sure, Dad's ok, but he doesn't hold a candle to Mom, who is, bar none, their very best friend.\n\nToday, all of us celebrate the women in our lives who make us who we are.

For five and a half years, it was an honor to work side-by-side with Abbott. He will make an outstanding governor.\n\nJohn Cornyn, our senior senator, won his primary as well. John is a friend, and a good man. He's earned considerable respect in the Senate. We have not agreed on everything, but we have agreed on the vast majority of issues. Together, we're a strong and effective team for Texas.\n\nGeorge P. Bush convincingly won his primary for for Land Commissioner. George was one of my very first supporters in our Senate race, and he and his wife Mandi are long-time friends. He's smart, generous, and has a heart for service.

Today, we commemorate that moment by thanking our veterans who have continued the quest to preserve our peace and freedom.\n\nWe should all be proud of our country’s long tradition of service. General John J. Pershing eloquently expressed his thanks in a letter to the troops who helped win the “war to end all wars,” that is just as relevant now as it was then.\n\nPershing wrote, “By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor, strength and indomitable will, made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation, you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.”\n\nWe are so fortunate that throughout history, millions of Americans have come forward to fight tyrants, fascists, communists, and terrorists to keep us free.\n\nStill, we live in a violent world, where the freedoms we enjoy remain exceptional to millions of less fortunate forced to abide by brutal dictators, oppressive regimes, and cultures of intolerance.\n\nThe persistent threats of terrorism at home and abroad are reminders of how precious it is to be an American and how fiercely our rights must be protected.\n\nWe are blessed to live in a society where men and women continue to fight for our flag. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, more than 3 million Americans have volunteered to defend their country, knowing full well the risks they may face. More than 50,000 are serving in Afghanistan right now.\n\nThey, like millions of veterans before them, are willingly putting themselves in danger to keep us safe.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge once said, “The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.” He was right.\n\nPlease join me on this Veterans Day in saying a prayer of thanks for our veterans.

Abstract notions about international norms should never displace U.S. sovereignty to act, or refuse to act, for our national security.\n\nAssad’s murderous actions have claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand of his own people, which is a humanitarian tragedy. But our chief strategic concern should not be international norms; it should be preventing the chemical weapons from falling into the hands of al Qaeda or other terrorists who might use them against us and our allies.\n\nIt is now incumbent upon President Obama to make his case and persuade Congress that his plan is necessary, and the best course to preserve our security and protect our liberties.

But that penalty does not apply to those with RPI status, giving a powerful incentive for job creators to hire illegal immigrants instead of U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. That is indefensible.

This is completely and utterly unacceptable; we cannot selfishly spend away the futures of our children.

Some went to a recruiting center to assist the young people who, like so many before them, would walk through the door on any given Thursday morning and volunteer to defend the United States of America. Four brave Marines went to a Naval Reserve Center to perform their duties to the Tennessee National Guard.\n\nBut one of the young people who visited two of those facilities was not like the others. He was there not to volunteer to serve America, but to attack America. Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was there to carry out jihad, an act of radical Islamic terrorism. An act of war, in which those four brave Marines lost their lives, while at least two others were wounded.\n\nIn the wake of this vicious attack on our nation we need to rid ourselves of two dangerous delusions, first and foremost that a \"lone gunman\"–as President Obama described the shooter–is somehow isolated from the larger threat of radical Islamic terrorism. In the modern world, no one acts in isolation. Through social media ISIS, al Qaida and other groups are infiltrating our nation with impunity while our government will not even admit that radical Islamic terrorism is a problem.\n\nThe second delusion is that this attack is somehow isolated from previous episodes, notably those in Little Rock, Arkansas and Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009—both of which were attacks on American military facilities. The Obama administration was woefully reluctant to call either an act of radical Islamic terrorism, instead suggesting \"workplace violence\" as a justification for the killings. Finally, after years of effort, the victims of Fort Hood were properly recognized as victims of attacks by foreign terrorists when they received Purple Hearts on April 15, 2015. Likewise, the victim of the Little Rock attack received a Purple Heart on July 1, 2015.\n\nWe cannot afford wait six years to recognize what happened yesterday in Chattanooga for what it was. We need to see with clarity right now what has happened. We can immediately hold hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee on the need for our enlisted men and women to have the right to be armed in military facilities. Congress can pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act that would allow our government to stop Americans who travel overseas to train with terrorist groups from coming back to attack us at home. We can thoroughly overhaul our broken immigration system that is allowing this type of individual to gain citizenship. And we can accept the reality that while we might wish it otherwise, the forces of radical Islam are at war with us.","2015-07-17 18:26:07+00","69983322463_10153445558042464",1],[3975,"The Texas \u0026 Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association knows firsthand that we have got to stop the Obama Administration's abusive enforcement of environmental laws. \r\n\r\nLIKE if you agree!","2012-09-26 17:02:08+00","69983322463_10151233474477464",1],[3976,"San Antonio Area Friends: Quick reminder about TONIGHT's fundraising reception in San Antonio to support our campaign and help send a proven conservative to the US Senate.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to join us, it's not too late to RSVP!

Sixty years ago yesterday the guns fell silent across the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe armistice that ended hostilities in the devastating war that had raged across this country for more than three years had come into effect.\n\nThis terrible conflict, that claimed three million lives, began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea launched an all-out invasion of its southern neighbour. The United Nations responded promptly to this act of blatant aggression by asking its members to help defend the Republic of Korea. Sixteen nations answered this call by sending combat troops and others provided non-combatant support.\n\nWithin days New Zealand offered the services of two Royal New Zealand Navy frigates. In July New Zealand decided to commit a ground force based on an artillery regiment to serve as part of the United Nations Command. New Zealand's contribution was small, but was a significant one for our country. In total about 6000 Royal New Zealand Navy and New Zealand Army personnel served in Korea between 1950 and 1957 of whom 45 lost their lives.\n\nContinue reading: http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1693-Speech-to-New-Zealand-National-Service,-United-Nations-Memorial-Cemetery,-Busan,-South-Korea.html","2013-07-28 03:11:16+00","12635800428_10151803162210429",2],[6368,"On the bullet train to Busan for the NZ Memorial Service to commemorate the Korean War Armistice.","2013-07-27 23:33:25+00","12635800428_10151802841530429",2],[6371,"Speech: Address to Armistice Commemoration Ceremony, Seoul, South Korea\nhttp://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1692-Address-to-Armistice-Commemoration-Ceremony,-Seoul,-South-Korea.html\n\nMadam President, distinguished guests, honoured veterans, ladies and gentlemen\n\nIt is an honour to address you on behalf of the countries invited here today to commemorate, with our Korean partners, the 60th anniversary of the Armistice Agreement which ended hostilities in the Korean War.\n\nWe are here to remember the heroism and the sacrifices of Korean and allied troops from 21 nations large and small, including my country New Zealand, which answered the call of the Korean government and the United Nations.\n\nWe remember with gratitude those who gave their lives to defend freedom, as well as the many thousands who were wounded.\n\nWe also thank the veterans of the conflict, many of whom are here today.\n\nYour selflessness and courage in the most difficult conditions will never be forgotten.\n\nContinue reading: http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1692-Address-to-Armistice-Commemoration-Ceremony,-Seoul,-South-Korea.html","2013-07-27 02:45:28+00","12635800428_10151801296235429",2],[6373,"Media release: PM meets with Korean President Park Geun-hye\nhttp://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1691-PM-meets-with-Korean-President-Park-Geun-hye.html\n\nPrime Minister John Key met today for bilateral talks with Korea’s new President Park Geun-hye at the ‘Blue House’ in Seoul.\n\nPresident Park took office as Korea’s first woman head of state in February 2013.\n\n“I congratulated President Park on a successful start to her administration,” Mr Key says.\n\n“The President is a good friend of New Zealand.

It’s great to be here.\n\nI’d like to acknowledge your President, Lawrence Yule, and your board members for their hard work. I enjoy a great working relationship with Lawrence and meet regularly with him and LGNZ chief executive Malcolm Alexander.\n\nI often meet mayors and councillors when I am travelling around New Zealand, and it’s great to see so many familiar faces here today. I’d especially like to acknowledge Hamilton Mayor, Julie Hardaker.\n\nI’d also like to acknowledge my colleague the Local Government Minister, Chris Tremain, for his work helping to take the relationships with local government forward.\n\nThere is something else I’d also like to acknowledge today, and that is the role of local government during emergencies.\n\nI speak to you today following the recent series of significant earthquakes in the upper end of the South Island and lower North Island.\n\nSuch events can be terrifying and draining for the residents in the affected communities, as the Canterbury earthquakes showed. It is at times like this that residents look to local government not just for resources and assistance, but leadership and reassurance.\n\nI’d like to congratulate Wellington Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown, and other local government representatives in the affected districts, for their responses to this latest series of earthquakes.\n\nI’d also like to publicly pay tribute to Christchurch’s out-going mayor Bob Parker. Bob showed great leadership in Christchurch during some exceptionally difficult circumstances and his commitment to the city during its darkest hours will be his legacy.\n\nThank you, Bob, for everything you have done.\n\nThe example he set, and the response from local government in recent days with the latest earthquakes, again underlines the importance of the leadership role local government plays not just during earthquakes, but during every other type of emergency like floods or heavy snowfalls.\n\nOur four priorities\n\nWhen I spoke at your last conference in Queenstown, I outlined the four priorities that the National-led Government is focused on this term. A year on, I can report that these priorities are still driving our work programme and they are central to the future prosperity of this country.\n\nTo recap briefly, our first priority is to responsibly manage the Government’s finances.\n\nTaking on more debt has been appropriate to support the economy and cushion New Zealanders from major shocks like the recession, the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes.\n\nBut, as households around the country know, carrying substantial debt is neither comfortable nor financially prudent.\n\nSo we have committed to returning the Government’s books to surplus in 2014/15 and we are on track to achieve this.\n\nWe are also on track to reduce net government debt to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.\n\nAnd we are achieving this while still spending $5.1 billion on new initiatives over the next four years – funded, in part, by reprioritising existing spending.\n\nOur second priority this term is to continue building a more competitive and productive economy.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains uncertain.\n\nDespite this, New Zealand is in good shape, especially when you compare us with other developed countries. The economy grew 2.4 per cent last year, making us one of the faster-growing countries in the OECD.\n\nForecasts are for growth to continue at between 2 and 3 per cent a year. As business confidence increases, more jobs are being created, and wages are going up, which is good news for New Zealand families and communities.\n\nOur third priority is to deliver better public services to New Zealanders within tight financial constraints. We are doing that across the board.\n\nIn particular, we have a four- to five-year programme of delivering in 10 specific target areas. Recently, we reported our progress to New Zealand. I’m pleased to say that in all 10 of our target areas, we’ve made progress.\n\nOur fourth and final priority is to rebuild greater Christchurch, our second-largest city. This is the largest economic undertaking in New Zealand’s history, but it is progressing quickly, and that is great to see.\n\nBetter Local Government reforms\n\nLast year when I spoke to you, we had just begun work on passing the Bill that enabled phase one of our Better Local Government reforms.\n\nThese reforms are designed to give you the tools to keep rates affordable, set clear financial prudence requirements, and give councils more tools to better manage costs.\n\nWe are putting a focus on stronger governance, improved efficiency, and better fiscal management at the local government level.\n\nWe are aware that LGNZ has been focused on improving governance with your members, too. I thank you for your contribution towards this. Your announcement of a partnership between LGNZ and the Institute of Directors on professional development training for elected representatives is a welcome step forward.\n\nChanging the way you operate, and bringing a sharp focus on better leadership is not unique to local government. Governments at all levels across the world are being forced to reconsider what ‘business as usual’ means in this new global economic environment.\n\nLiving within our means is the way of the future. Businesses, households and families are taking notice of this new reality.\n\nThe first phase of Better Local Government reforms is helping local government to play its part in the belt-tightening that has been a reality for government, businesses, households and individuals over the past few years.\n\nAt the end of last year, these reforms passed into law.\n\nThe second phase of reform is now underway. There is an even bigger focus on efficiency, with the work done by the Efficiency Taskforce and the Local Government Infrastructure Expert Advisory Group. The recommendations from these two bodies have formed the basis for more policy decisions.\n\nFurther to this, the local government reorganisation reforms have enhanced the ability for councils to amalgamate, and are provoking a lot of discussion and activity in a number of communities.\n\nChanges to structure can lead to better governance. As we can see with the Auckland city amalgamation, processes are streamlined, and efficiencies across Auckland have been found.\n\nAs I have said before, the Government will not force amalgamations. What we wanted with this reform was to make it easier for communities to achieve structural change if they decide that was the right move for their community.\n\nNo-one knows better than you the importance of your sector, and how much of a difference local government can make to New Zealand’s economic success. That’s why it is important we get these reforms right.\n\nReforming the RMA\n\nIn February, the Government released a discussion document that contained a comprehensive package of resource management reforms.\n\nThe way the current resource management processes are operating is costing us all in time, money and lost opportunities. The systems have become cumbersome, uncertain and highly litigious.\n\nDelays and uncertainties from the RMA means potential new jobs are not being created, houses are more expensive and communities have no idea what to expect in their neighbourhood.\n\nFundamentally, the second set of RMA reforms are about providing greater confidence for businesses to grow and create jobs. The RMA reforms will bring greater certainty for communities to plan for their area’s needs, and strong environmental outcomes as our communities grow and change.\n\nGovernment heard hundreds of submissions and held more than 50 meetings throughout the country on these reforms. The Government expects to be in a position to progress the resource management reforms in the next month.\n\nHousing\n\nAn issue I would like to address in particular with you today is housing.\n\nHousing is a very important issue. We all know the rising cost of housing is a great concern in Auckland and, to a lesser degree, Christchurch. We also know it is an issue around the country.\n\nThe Government’s view is that we can improve the supply side of the housing market so that housing becomes more affordable.\n\nThat is why we are looking at establishing Housing Accords, in partnership with local government, to create special housing areas.\n\nThe first of these Accords is with Auckland, and what it does is give Auckland Council the tools it needs to get on and consent thousands more sections.\n\nHousing Accords aim to streamline the planning and consenting process and get central and local government working more closely together on housing development.\n\nWe’ve set targets within the Auckland Accord to ensure the city’s housing supply and affordability issues are addressed. As a result of the Auckland Accord, we are targeting 39,000 new homes over the next three years, which is a significant increase in the number of homes currently being built in Auckland.\n\nI want to turn now to recent debate on the Reserve Bank’s proposal for loan to value ratios (LVRs) for residential mortgages.\n\nI have made my thoughts clear – first home buyers are a priority for the Government – that remains my view.\n\nIt is worth however, putting some context around the actions the Reserve Bank is considering.\n\nAbsent of any other alternative, then rapidly increasing house prices may see the Reserve Bank raising interest rates, which will affect everyone - all mortgage holders and businesses, whereever they are in the country, as well as the Government.\n\nThat is certainly not in the best interests of first home buyers.\n\nAnd higher interest rates would put upwards pressure on the Kiwi dollar, which would hurt exporters.\n\nEven with LVRs introduced, interest rates may ultimately rise anyway, but the intention with these loan to value ratios is to provide the Reserve Bank with other tools to dampen demand.\n\nHousing bubbles overseas, like in the US where subprime mortgages were hugely popular, had in the end a very negative impact on the American economy.\n\nIt left US banks and many homeowners very exposed and it had a dramatic negative flow-on impact, as we all saw.\n\nSo it’s an issue that has to be taken seriously here in New Zealand.\n\nIf it is left unchecked some buyers could find themselves substantially overexposed in an overvalued market. And we all know what happens if those values start to fall.\n\nSo, this issue is of serious concern. I remain of the view that all tools have to be considered. Demand-side issues are largely the purview of the RBNZ, which is independent, and they will in the end have to make a decision.\n\nThe Government is keen to see all New Zealanders have the opportunity to buy a house.\n\nPart of the mix is ensuring the economic fundamentals are right, people can get a job, and there is enough land supply. And affordable interest rates are part of the mix, too.\n\nSo this is a debate about getting the balance right between ensuring poeple have the opportunity to buy a home, and ensuring we don’t have problems with the banking system - with all the negative economic impacts that would entail.\n\nThe New Zealand cycle trail\n\nTurning now to another great example of a partnership between central and local government is the New Zealand Cycle Trail, which is almost 90 per cent complete.\n\nEleven Great Rides are now open, with nine more planned before the end of the year.\n\nOver the past five years, 318,000 cycling tourists have visited New Zealand, providing a significant boost for regional tourism.\n\nThe trails would not be possible without the support of local government, regional tourism organisations and local businesses. $30 million raised in co-funding arrangements demonstrates the significant commitment of communities to their local trails.\n\nI know that those involved in several trails have recently held workshops to plan how to maximise the returns to their region now that the construction phase is nearing completion. Thinking outside the square will enable local trails to create revenue and increase the economic benefits to their regions.\n\nEvery trail that has opened so far has led to spin-off benefits for the local community. New cafes, cycle transfer businesses, and growing demand for accommodation nearby cycle trials is great for our local communities.\n\nLocal elections\n\nI’d like to turn briefly to the local elections coming up in October. To those who are standing again for election, I wish you the best of luck on October 12. And to those who are not standing for re-election, thank you for your service to your communities.\n\nI want to say that the work you do, and the services that are provided by the organisations you represent, are important. Your communities rely on you.\n\nIt’s vital that when the opportunity comes along for the public to exercise their right to vote for their elected representatives, they take the time to do so.\n\nVoter turnout at the local body elections in 2007 was the lowest turnout since the restructuring of local government in 1989. In 2010, voter turnout improved slightly to 47.5 per cent.\n\nIt would be great to see that turnout improve again at this election and I encourage New Zealanders to have their say.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s important for New Zealand’s future economic success that we work well together. I believe our relationship is in good heart, and I know that you are not afraid to tell me your thoughts on central government’s programme.\n\nWhile central and local government have different core functions, both are facing similar challenges. And those involved in both are committed to leaving New Zealand in better shape than when we found it.\n\nAnd just as central government does, local government also needs to work on delivering better services to New Zealanders within tight financial constraints.\n\nI appreciate the work you do, and the challenges you face. We are committed to supporting you.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to work closely with local government across New Zealand.\n\nThank you and enjoy the rest of your conference.","2013-07-22 22:07:26+00","12635800428_10151792006660429",2],[6387,"Here is NZ’s gift to the royal baby – a fine lace shawl, hand spun by Cynthia Read.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: Sacha Kahaki","2013-07-22 20:58:34+00","12635800428_10151791804850429",2],[6389,"Congratulations Prince William and Catherine on the birth of your son.

The latest data shows this rate has more than halved to 0.9 per cent.\n\n“While this is positive, the reality is there are still around 25,000 longer-term, heavy users of the drug, who are locked in a cycle of dependence, causing misery and angst for them, their families and loved ones,” says Mr Key.\n\nContinue reading \u003e\u003e http://www.johnkey.co.nz//archives/1664-Meth-plan-continues-to-show-results.html","2013-05-23 01:33:21+00","12635800428_10151670304370429",2],[6480,"This morning I cut the ribbon to officially open Allied Pickfords’ new $4.1m warehouse in Christchurch.","2013-05-22 22:10:36+00","12635800428_10151670052065429",2],[6481,"I'm with the team at the Copthorne Commodore Hotel in Christchurch to celebrate the opening of 20 new rooms","2013-05-22 21:26:49+00","12635800428_10151669982535429",2],[6484,"Delivering a Budget for families \n\nThe National-led Government’s fifth Budget, which we released to New Zealand last week, has been extremely well received.

By the end of it, we expect investment announcements across a range of energy projects in the region,” Mr Key says.\n\nMr Key says the investment showcase will run in parallel with the Summit and exhibit the latest in renewable energy technologies along with the engineering, infrastructure and consultancy services required to make that technology work. The event itself will be partially powered by solar panels installed by Vector for the summit.\n\nMr Key urged the diverse audience of more than 400 delegates and 100 companies to make the most of this unique event. \n\n“By pooling resources, experiences and talents over the next two days we can put the Pacific firmly on the path to greater energy security and independence,” Mr Key says.\n\nhttp://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1625-PM-welcomes-cooperation-for-Pacific-Energy.html","2013-03-24 06:08:33+00","12635800428_10151571111760429",2],[6598,"New edition of Key Notes now online.

The initial three-month phase will see 6,086 officers using the new technology, rising to 6,500 by mid-2014.\n\nAn 11-month Police pilot indicated officers would be able to save about 30 minutes each eight-hour shift by using the new technology – about 520,000 hours per year based on the initial rollout to 6,086 officers.\n\n“Put another way, that’s equivalent to about 345 extra frontline Police being more active and visible in our communities,” says Mr Key.\n\nContinue reading: http://www.johnkey.co.nz//archives/1597-Police-roll-out-new-technology-to-fight-crime.html","2013-02-13 01:56:24+00","12635800428_10151496827960429",2],[6678,"Police will be rolling out mobile technology to over 6,000 frontline Police officers to help them fight crime.","2013-02-12 21:41:51+00","12635800428_10151496492315429",2],[6629,"PM welcomes extension of Chilean education scheme\n\nPrime Minister John Key has welcomed the Chilean Government’s move to extend its “Penguins Without Borders” scheme, which sees high-achieving Chilean students travelling to New Zealand for six-monthly study visits.\n\n“Penguins Without Borders enables some of Chile’s most ambitious and brightest high school students to experience the best our education system has to offer,” says Mr Ley\n\n“Chile’s Economy Minister, Pablo Longueira, has announced today that the pilot scheme of 40 students will now be widened to 100 for terms three and four this year.\n\n“There is the potential for this to lay the foundations for a regular study programme in New Zealand for high-achieving Chilean students.”\n\nMr Key is in Chile leading a trade mission of New Zealand businesses. \n\nNew Zealand was the first country to be selected by the Chilean Government for the Penguins Without Borders programme in 2012.\n\n“New Zealand’s selection as the pilot country for this programme speaks volumes for the high regard in which our education system is held,” says Mr Key.\n\n“All up, around 700 Chilean students studied in New Zealand in 2012.

During a trip to Papua New Guinea for the Pacific Forum Leaders' meeting and a subsequent stopover in the Solomon Islands, his cast was signed by a number of international dignitaries, including Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Now that signed cast - which will come off in the next two weeks - is available to bidders on TradeMe. The beneficiary of the winning bid will be The Fred Hollows Foundation NZ, which operates blindness prevention programmes in the Pacific. The Foundation estimates there are 5,000 blind people in the Solomon Islands, mainly needing cataract surgery. A further 15,000 will be suffering from poor vision from cataracts and the need for glasses. Five eye doctors and 20 eye nurses are required to address blindness and vision disability in the Solomon Islands. There are currently two eye doctors and 12 eye nurses working in the Solomon Islands. John Key will also sign the cast and - subject to scheduling arrangements - will meet with the winning bidder for morning tea.","2009-02-01 03:29:19+00","12635800428_64747815428",2],[8429,"Statement on Paula Bennett","2009-01-31 06:49:34+00","12635800428_64569820428",2],[8430,"","2009-01-29 23:08:34+00","12635800428_64307650428",2],[8433,"Prime Minister Video Journal 1","2009-01-21 03:32:58+00","12635800428_46091248177",2],[8437,"Please do not engage in any form of  racism on this page.","2009-01-13 08:20:57+00","12635800428_10150434354060429",2],[8438,"Release of briefings to the incoming Prime Minister","2008-12-15 22:10:02+00","12635800428_55227375428",2],[8439,"ReStart to help people made redundant","2008-12-15 04:31:30+00","12635800428_40048378177",2],[8440,"NEWS: Government honours Herceptin promise","2008-12-11 05:35:36+00","12635800428_54376650428",2],[8441,"Speech from the Throne","2008-12-09 09:05:02+00","12635800428_54005725428",2],[8443,"VIDEO: Press conference on Thailand, ACC","2008-12-03 02:29:30+00","12635800428_38204403177",2],[8444,"Photos taken at the Bikes for Kids tour by the children's charity Variety. \r\nThe week long tour involves Variety volunteers presenting 450 bikes to children from low decile schools nationwide who have been identified as role models in their schools and communities.  100 bikes were presented in Auckland on Sunday - the PM presented the first 10.","2008-12-02 05:13:23+00","12635800428_52693850428",2],[8445,"VIDEO: PM's press conference on Air NZ, Mumbai, Thailand","2008-11-28 04:25:46+00","12635800428_51972355428",2],[8448,"Activities on the first day in Government - from the swearing in ceremony to the first meeting of the Cabinet","2008-11-20 01:17:21+00","12635800428_50542225428",2],[8449,"Prime Minister to attend Apec Leader’s Summit","2008-11-20 00:10:25+00","12635800428_36282603177",2],[8451,"NEWS: National's Ministry focused on growth, prosperity","2008-11-17 03:42:51+00","12635800428_50008300428",2],[8454,"Post-election photos","2008-11-14 00:46:15+00","12635800428_49504190428",2],[8456,"Post-election photos","2008-11-11 04:17:57+00","12635800428_48990065428",2],[8457,"Post-election photos","2008-11-10 04:29:13+00","12635800428_48792675428",2],[8458,"Wellington - working traffic in the rain - 07 November","2008-11-07 00:43:13+00","12635800428_48253895428",2],[8460,"Campaign blog: 06 November","2008-11-06 02:03:10+00","12635800428_48091570428",2],[8465,"","2008-11-02 23:45:55+00","12635800428_47443565428",2],[8467,"Campaign blog: 03 November","2008-11-02 21:43:14+00","12635800428_47418450428",2],[8468,"NEWS: National's 21st century school building plan","2008-11-02 02:37:11+00","12635800428_33614223177",2],[8473,"NEWS: National announces Action Plan for Violent Crime","2008-10-30 04:16:37+00","12635800428_33226418177",2],[8474,"NEWS: Desperation drips from latest smear attempt","2008-10-29 06:10:39+00","12635800428_33098128177",2],[8479,"NEWS: Boosting access to medicines","2008-10-23 00:17:21+00","12635800428_32254953177",2],[8481,"NEWS: Waikato Expressway: Road of National Significance","2008-10-20 20:59:22+00","12635800428_31955873177",2],[8482,"","2008-10-20 02:57:22+00","12635800428_45007100428",2],[8483,"Campaign blog: 20 October","2008-10-19 21:49:35+00","12635800428_31787163177",2],[8484,"NEWS: Statement on New Zealand Banking System","2008-10-19 04:44:51+00","12635800428_44814835428",2],[8487,"NEWS: National - Better value from your taxes","2008-10-16 00:21:38+00","12635800428_31317053177",2],[8488,"NEWS: National policy - No mum to be forced home after birth","2008-10-13 23:06:34+00","12635800428_31040113177",2],[8492,"NEWS: Helen Clark has no new answers to turbulence","2008-10-08 22:25:33+00","12635800428_43195880428",2],[8493,"","2013-06-18 03:57:15+00","12635800428_10151720671020429",2],[8495,"NEWS: Tax remains an important part of economic plan","2008-10-07 03:15:54+00","12635800428_42897330428",2],[8496,"NEWS: No parole for worst repeat violent offenders under National","2008-10-05 21:26:27+00","12635800428_42658555428",2],[8497,"","2008-10-04 05:11:37+00","12635800428_42403525428",2],[8500,"Brian Donnelly remembered","2008-09-25 06:19:32+00","12635800428_28695733177",2],[8501,"NEWS: Labour threats to Maori Party concerning","2008-09-24 05:55:47+00","12635800428_40880025428",2],[8504,"NEWS: Broadband plan to get NZ up to speed","2008-09-15 01:42:05+00","12635800428_39457285428",2],[8505,"","2008-09-14 03:29:40+00","12635800428_39301325428",2],[8506,"NEWS: National welcomes election date","2008-09-12 05:16:04+00","12635800428_39033645428",2],[8507,"NEWS: Delivering better healthcare: Patients come first","2008-09-11 00:54:22+00","12635800428_27016488177",2],[8508,"In London?
