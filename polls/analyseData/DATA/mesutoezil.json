This fills me with great pride, gratitude, and I see it as an inducement. Even before the World Cup we´ve talked about what could i do, that would be sustainable in Brazil. Friends made me aware of the good work of BigShoe at that time. This organization gives children a normal life by doing successful surgeries. Therefore we decided to help in my name eleven children with surgeries before the World Cup. My „Eleven\" - the best team in the world. My team. After the World Cup I increased the number of surgeries to 23 - also because we had 23 players in the      DFB-Team. We´ve chosen children with cleft lip and deformities for the surgeries. Now I get this award from Laureus Sport for Good Stiftung on Wednesday for my total commitment this year - and I accept it as well in the name of the medicals and Bigshoe workers. And as well of other volunteers who are committed to help disadvantaged children all over the world. Let us keep up the good work to help these children. #LaureusSportforGood #Bigshoe\n\nJetzt ist es offiziell: ich erhalte den Laureus Ehrenpreis für Wohltätigkeit. Das erfüllt mich mit großem Stolz, Dankbarkeit und ich sehe es auch als Ansporn. \nSchon vor der WM haben wir darüber gesprochen: Was kann man machen, dass in Brasilien etwas Nachhaltiges bleibt. Freunde haben mich damals auf die gute Arbeit von Bigshoe aufmerksam gemacht. Eine Institution, die dafür sorgt, dass es kranken Kindern nach Operationen besser geht und ihnen den Zugang zu einem normalen Leben ermöglicht wird. So haben wir vor der WM entschieden, elf Kinder-Operationen zu übernehmen und meinen Namen einzubringen. Meine „Elf“ – die beste Elf der Welt. Meine Mannschaft. Nach der WM habe ich dann auf 23 aufgestockt – auch, weil wir 23 Spieler im DFB-Team waren. Operiert wurden Kinder, die an Lippen-Kiefer-Gaumenspalte und an Verkrüppelungen gelitten haben. \nJetzt bekomme ich von der Laureus Sport for Good Stiftung am Mittwoch diesen Preis für mein Gesamtengagement in diesem Jahr – und ich nehme ihn auch stellvertretend für die Ärzte und Bigshoe entgegen. Und für alle anderen freiwilligen und ehrenamtlichen Helfer, die sich für benachteiligte Kinder in dieser Welt einsetzen. Lasst uns weiter daran arbeiten, diesen Kindern zu helfen.\n\nArtik resmi: Sosyal yardim dalinda Laureus odulunu aldim. Bu benim icin cok ozel ve cok buyuk bir onur. Dunya Kupasi oncesinde Brezilya icin neler yapabiliriz uzerine cok konusmustuk. BigShoe organizasyonundan arkadaslarim beni haberdar etti.
