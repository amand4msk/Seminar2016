Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear for one reason: to get votes. He’s encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes.\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to round up millions of Latino immigrants and kick them out of the United States—a nation built by immigrants. He wants to ban all Muslims from the United States—a country founded on religious freedom. He supports torture, advocates killing the wives and children of our enemies, and had to be told that these are war crimes in violation of international law, our own laws, our most deeply held principles, and our Constitution. And after stoking every fire he can think of, Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him—literally punch them in the face—and then offers to pay their legal bills. \n\nNow, at our best, Americans have rejected demagogues and fear mongers. You don’t make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great in the first place.

We need to give more support to students who are also parents. So, here's a new plan: We're going to create a scholarship program for student parents, called SPARK—Student Parents in America Raising Kids. It will give extra financial help for student parents who keep their grades up. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to help pay for gas or a babysitter—just the kind of extra help that can keep somebody in school. \n\nWe're also going to significantly increase access to quality childcare on college campuses. Childcare centers already exist on some campuses, but a lot of parents don't have any safe, affordable place to leave their kids while they go to school. \n\nThe financial benefits of all this are clear: Students with college degrees can earn more than a half a million dollars over their lifetimes more than students with high school degrees. When a parent is able to get that education that so many parents work for, it really makes a difference. This is going to be good for kids, for students, and for parents.

The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate, but the thinking, and the attitude, toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten. \n\nSo yes, it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive, outrageous, pick your adjective. But what Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican party is today as anybody else on that stage. And it is deeply troubling, and it should be to the press, not just to those who fight for women’s health and rights.","2015-08-14 17:15:51+00","889307941125736_961889437200919",7],[8253,"Today is Social Security's 80th birthday.
