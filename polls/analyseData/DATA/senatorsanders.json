The Republican budget would throw 27 million Americans off of health insurance and make draconian cuts to education, nutrition, affordable housing and prescription drug coverage. Meanwhile, that same budget provides huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in the country.\n\n“The Republican budget moves us in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of creating jobs, it cuts jobs. Instead of making college more affordable, it cuts Pell Grants. Instead of helping to eliminate hunger in America, it will add to the financial problems of low-income Americans and create more hunger. This is Robin Hood in reverse. It takes from the poor and working families, and gives to the rich and large corporations,” said Bernie, who led the opposition to the Republican budget as ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nDuring the week-long debate, Republicans rejected proposals to put Americans back to work, raise the minimum wage, help students afford college, and protect seniors on Social Security and Medicare.\n \nBudget Facts: Read how the GOP budget would affect Vermonters:\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/the-gop-budget-is-a-disaster-for-vermont","2015-04-13 20:53:49+00","9124187907_10153216202382908",10],[13620,"","2015-04-11 17:34:01+00","9124187907_10153210561682908",10],[13622,"","2015-04-10 17:11:01+00","9124187907_10153208108802908",10],[13624,"","2015-04-09 17:21:37+00","9124187907_10153205729782908",10],[13625,"","2015-04-08 13:05:00+00","9124187907_10153202815497908",10],[13626,"","2015-04-16 13:11:01+00","9124187907_10153223110882908",10],[13628,"","2015-04-07 21:05:01+00","9124187907_10153201453742908",10],[13632,"","2015-04-06 12:30:01+00","9124187907_10153197939577908",10],[13634,"","2015-04-04 18:39:50+00","9124187907_10153192764872908",10],[13636,"","2015-04-02 14:14:20+00","9124187907_10153187449942908",10],[13637,"","2015-03-30 18:11:24+00","9124187907_10153180298577908",10],[13639,"","2015-03-29 18:21:45+00","9124187907_10153177625502908",10],[13641,"","2015-03-28 16:13:36+00","9124187907_10153174721287908",10],[13643,"","2015-03-27 14:05:57+00","9124187907_10153171950632908",10],[13644,"","2015-03-27 00:35:00+00","9124187907_10153170830342908",10],[13646,"","2015-03-26 13:28:21+00","9124187907_10153169526952908",10],[13648,"","2015-03-25 00:30:07+00","9124187907_10153165916092908",10],[13651,"","2015-03-23 21:25:01+00","9124187907_10153163038317908",10],[13653,"","2015-03-22 00:34:00+00","9124187907_10153158505277908",10],[13654,"","2015-03-21 17:15:00+00","9124187907_10153157659997908",10],[13656,"","2015-03-21 13:15:01+00","9124187907_10153157192897908",10],[13658,"","2015-03-19 21:19:41+00","9124187907_10153153034147908",10],[13660,"","2015-11-25 22:15:55+00","9124187907_10154369562742908",10],[13662,"","2015-03-19 00:45:01+00","9124187907_10153151180932908",10],[13665,"","2015-03-17 16:45:00+00","9124187907_10153148036597908",10],[13667,"","2015-03-16 21:45:00+00","9124187907_10153146359717908",10],[13668,"","2015-03-16 17:10:01+00","9124187907_10153145776452908",10],[13671,"Tomorrow: Choral Concert Featuring Vermont High School Choruses: \n\nSen.

Bernie Sanders is Jewish. He’s also the likely 2016 presidential candidate whose political philosophy lines up most closely with the economic and social theories of Pope Francis.\n\nAs he mused on the possibility of a 2016 campaign during an hour-long visit to TIME’s Washington Bureau Thursday, Sanders hit the Pope’s main talking points before even mentioning his name. Health care as a universal right for the elderly. The economic injustices of income inequality. Climate change.\n\nUnlike many leaders who name-drop Pope Francis to score political points—he is, after all, likely the most popular man on the planet—Sanders quotes the Pope because he actually believes his message. When asked about casino capitalism, Sanders points to Pope Francis, who says that is not what human life should be. “He’s saying, you know what…the economy should serve people, not people serving the economy,” Sanders explains. “The market is the billionaire class who want to get richer, that is what it is. I don’t think we should have an economy serving their needs.”\n\nContinue reading here: http://time.com/3661552/bernie-sanders-pope-francis/","2015-01-11 13:55:00+00","9124187907_10152986579302908",10],[13804,"","2015-01-09 13:55:00+00","9124187907_10152985621307908",10],[13806,"","2015-01-10 17:05:00+00","9124187907_10152988028657908",10],[13808,"","2015-01-08 13:55:01+00","9124187907_10152983394237908",10],[13810,"","2015-01-07 01:45:01+00","9124187907_10152980153507908",10],[13812,"","2015-01-05 21:30:00+00","9124187907_10152977073572908",10],[13814,"","2015-01-04 18:30:01+00","9124187907_10152974285477908",10],[13698,"Join Sen.

Bernie Sanders, The Huffington Post:\n\nAs I look ahead to this coming year, a number of thoughts come to mind.\n\nFirst and foremost, against an enormous amount of corporate media noise and distraction, it is imperative that we not lose sight of what is most important and the vision that we stand for. We have got to stay focused on those issues that impact the lives of tens of millions of Americans who struggle every day to keep their heads above water economically, and who worry deeply about the kind of future their kids will have.\n\nYes. We make no apologies in stating that the great moral, economic and political issue of our time is the growing level of income and wealth inequality in our nation. It is a disgrace to everything this country is supposed to stand for when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when one family (the Waltons) owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. No. The economy is not sustainable when the middle class continues to disappear and when 95 percent of all new income generated since the Wall Street crash goes to the top 1 percent. In order to create a vibrant economy, working families need disposable income. That is often not the case today. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/fight-for-our-progressive_b_6391234.html","2014-12-29 17:45:31+00","9124187907_10152932871612908",10],[13830,"The Week in Review: \n\nHome for the holidays in Vermont, Sen.

Within a state or even within a single city, life expectancy can vary widely depending on the neighborhood. Every American is affected by these disparities.

In Rutland, for example, gas could be purchased last week for little more than $3.30 a gallon. Meanwhile, people filling up in St. Albans and Burlington were forced to pay about 30 cents more per gallon. The cost to fuel distributors to haul gas 75 miles adds about a nickel to the price of a gallon of gas, according to a pricing expert at the Oil Price Information Service. In other words, there is no economic justification for gas in northwestern Vermont to cost 30 cents more a gallon than in Rutland.\n\nRead more: \nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/high-gas-prices-a-possible-solution-from-kentucky?utm_source=vtbuzz\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_content=Headline+IMG+featured\u0026utm_campaign=Vermont+Bernie+Buzz+09-05\n","2014-09-08 22:05:00+00","9124187907_10152661916872908",10],[14083,"","2014-09-07 00:05:00+00","9124187907_10152657793577908",10],[14085,"Sanders Proposes Wealth Tax; Piketty, Reich Applaud: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/sanders-proposes-wealth-tax-piketty-reich-applaud","2014-09-06 16:00:01+00","9124187907_10152656894627908",10],[14131,"Town Meeting on the Economy - Jericho, Vermont:\n\nPlease join Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nGlobal Warming: Partisan differences over global warming flared during a Senate hearing Thursday. Democrats on the Senate environment committee called climate-change skeptics delusional and stressed that virtually every scientist agrees that global warming is real and caused by humans. Sen. Bernie Sanders cited the “overwhelming” evidence, Gannett News Service reported. “To deny the fact that the overwhelming majority of scientists who have published peer review articles believe not only is global warming real, but it is man-made, and to continue discussion of ‘we are not sure, let’s look at something else’, is almost beyond intellectual comprehension,” Sanders said in the Los Angeles Times. \n\nStudent Loans: Under pressure from the White House, Senate leaders plan to tie federal student loan interest rates to market rates which are expected to rise. Sen. Sanders “says the deal is a disaster because rates could rise to 8.5 percent,” Bob Kinzel tweeted for Vermont Public Radio. The Boston Globe said Sanders plans an amendment that would sunset the bill in two years before interest rates are expected to rise. He urged colleagues not to “collapse on this issue. Roll Call doubted that amendments by Sens. Jack Reed and Sanders would pass.\n\nRail Trail: Sen. Sanders will take part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the long-awaited Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, The Caledonian-Record reported. Sanders will be in St. Johnsbury on Friday evening for the event. The independent senator secured a $5.2 million grant for the trail in 2005. But it wasn't until last fall that the project was cleared for construction to start. Sanders' office says the rail trail will eventually run 93 miles between Swanton and St. Johnsbury along a former railroad right-of-way, The Associated Press, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. \n\nHigh-Speed Internet: “It’s nice to be on the cusp of a technology revolution for a change,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial about Sen. Sanders’ announcement that some towns in southeastern Vermont are getting the fastest consumer connection to the Internet anywhere in the United States. “Vermont may be on the verge of reaping enormous dividends from this historic investment in our future,” Sanders said of the new fiber optic service. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=92F89EED-CCA6-4706-A8B6-D213836D57D2","2013-07-19 13:01:58+00","9124187907_10151710006102908",10],[14021,"The Week in Review: \n\nThe People’s Climate March drew 400,000 demonstrators, including Sen.

On Friday, Sanders said strong majorities of Americans also want action on other critical issues – from jobs to income and wealth inequality to raising the minimum wage – but Republicans in Congress have blocked progress. “Ordinary Americans understand that the economy today is not doing well for the middle class or working families,” Sanders said on his weekly radio and Internet program with Thom Hartmann. “People know that the middle class is disappearing.

The Senate approved the $16.3 billion measure Thursday night, a day after it was overwhelmingly passed by the House, the Burlington Free Press, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. The Senate’s 91-3 vote came on the bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller, the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committee chairmen. \"Planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war,\" Sanders said in The Wall Street Journal. \"So is taking care of the men and women who use those weapons and fight our battles.\" \n\nObama Expected to Sign Sanders-Miller VA Bill:  President Obama is expected to sign the measure to provide $10 billion to allow veterans experiencing long appointment wait times, or who live far from VA facilities, to seek non-VA care. It would also provide $5 billion to hire new staff, including doctors and nurses. The VA secretary would also be given more power to fire under-performing executives. The bill also includes provisions for leasing new health-care facilities, The Washington Post reported.\n\nReining in Carbon Emissions: Sen. Sanders testified at an Environmental Protection Agency hearing Wednesday in support of a proposal to reduce carbon emissions at the nation’s power plants, WCAX.com and WCAX-TV reported. \"The times are critical,\" Sanders said. “There is not a whole lot of time left before we can transform our energy system.\" \n\nWisconsin Court Rules Against Workers: The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a law that significantly limits collective bargaining rights for most public workers, dealing a decisive blow to labor unions in the state and handing Gov. Scott Walker a victory. He drew national notice when he proposed it after taking office in 2011. In a 5-to-2 decision, justices rejected arguments that the restrictions on collective bargaining violated freedom of association and equal protection rights, The New York Times reported. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/080114","2014-08-01 12:26:14+00","9124187907_10152568101137908",10],[14174,"","2014-08-05 00:15:00+00","9124187907_10152576246277908",10],[14175,"Curbing Power Plant Pollution: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/curbing-power-plant-pollution","2014-07-30 17:40:07+00","9124187907_10152563813697908",10],[14178,"Today's news from Sen.

Sanders said there should be a limit on government security services’ access to phone records and Internet data from large companies such as Google and Facebook. Sanders opposed the renewal of the Patriot Act in 2011 because he felt it gave the government too much authority to monitor private phone records. He said his worst fears came true last week when it was revealed that the federal government had been secretly obtaining phone and Internet records of millions of people, according to an Associated Press report in the Times Argus and on WPTZ-TV. \n\nNSA Surveillance: Sanders told reporters he’s shocked by the breadth of the program. “I worry what it would mean for American civil liberties, but I will tell you I never ever expected that under any definition of that legislation that it would mean the phone calls of millions and millions of Americans — virtually none of whom the government has any reason to believe is involved in terrorism — would be checked by the United States government,” Sanders said in Politico. \n\nGlobal Warming: “We need to stop fiddling while the planet burns,” Marilyn Chapman wrote in an op-ed for the Morristown, N.J.

Republicans have raised questions about the legitimacy of estimates that the legislation could cost as much as $50 billion a year. No formal public meetings have been scheduled and the real negotiating is expected to take place largely behind the scenes. Meantime, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is working to schedule a confirmation hearing for Robert McDonald, the former corporate executive who is Obama's pick to be the next VA secretary. Chairman Bernie Sanders expects to receive McDonald's formal nomination from the White House this week and hopes to meet with nominee to discuss how he would lead the department, National Journal reported. \n\nHigh-Speed Internet: Lightning-fast Internet connectivity, telemedicine advances and even robot surrogates in classrooms are just a sampling of what state leaders and telecommunications companies like VTel hope will be coming to Vermont in the near future. VTel last Tuesday rolled out a statewide high-speed communications network in Hardwick that will serve sections of rural Vermont. Four years ago, Vermont ranked 35th in the nation in terms of broadband availability, according to David Weinstein, a representative of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sander’s office. After the projects are complete, officials hope the state will rank first, The Associated Press reported in an article published in Monday’s Times Argus and Rutland Herald. \n\nBattle Over Export Bank Heats Up: Lawmakers at a recent House hearing on the future of the Export-Import Bank were given an extra piece of reading material: a personalized index card laying out exactly which companies in their districts benefit from the financing agency and how many people they employ. The cards, which supporters of the bank plan to give to every member of Congress in coming weeks, are part of a lobbying push by corporations such as Boeing and General Electric and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers. Their goal is to combat the most serious threat yet to the survival of the agency, according to The Wall Street Journal. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/070714","2014-07-07 13:14:16+00","9124187907_10152508194692908",10],[14261,"The Declaration of Independence: A Revolutionary Document - By Sen.

The case decided on Monday involved home-care workers in Illinois whose hourly wages rose from $7 in 2003 to $13 in 2014. The workers also received health insurance paid for by the state and other benefits.

John McCain led the push for Senate passage of VA reform measure that would let veterans visit civilian doctors in certain circumstances. But Sanders worries that allowing visits to physicians outside the system will lead to the privatization of veterans care. He told The Associated Press that the real problem is a 16 percent increase in patients cared for by the VA from 2008 to 2013.\n\nU.S. Media Gives Platform to Iraq War Hawks: The architects of the Iraq war are back in TV studios and on op-ed pages, as are journalists and pundits who promoted the Bush administration’s ultimately bogus case for invading.

Chairman Sanders is sticking to his contention that the expenditures would address an emergency and therefore require no budget offsets.  “If it is not an emergency to have tens of thousands of veterans not getting the health care they need in a timely manner, then I’m not quite sure what an emergency is,” he said, according to Congressional Quarterly, The Washington Times. “The cost of war does not end when the last shots are fired and the last missiles are launched,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.\n\nGas Prices: Sen. Sanders said that speculators are using the Iraq crisis as an excuse to artificially drive up oil and gasoline prices. \"I am getting tired of big oil companies telling us that gasoline prices are going up because of the turmoil in Iraq,\" Sanders said. \"The truth is that big oil will never miss an opportunity to increase the price of gas.

Bernard Sanders, the Senate veterans committee chairman, told The New York Times. He will offer legislation to let VA patients who can’t get appointments go to community health centers, military hospitals or private doctors. He also wants to provide medical school scholarships and loan forgiveness as incentives to attract more physicians and nurses to careers at the VA. \n\nVA Health Centers: Veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are overwhelming underfunded VA facilities in the Southwest and South, Sen. Sanders told The New York Times. VA has set a goal of seeing patients within 14 days. “Do we have the staffing to achieve that goal?” Sanders asked. “In some parts of the country, clearly we do not.” As part of the solution, Sanders’ bill also would fund construction of 27 new VA health facilities, The Hill reported. \n\nVermont Yankee: A decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week not to endorse the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from pools to dry cask storage won’t have an effect on the anticipated transfer of the highly radioactive fuel at Vermont Yankee.

Long-term, the legislation authorizes the construction of 26 medical facilities and directs $500 million in unspent funds to hire more doctors and other health care providers, USA Today reported. \n\nThe Combat: “I’d like to say to the senator from Vermont that I respect a great deal the work that he has done on this legislation.

No doubt they will keep heaping abuse on President Obama, on the campaign trail, and at the hearings for whoever is nominated as Mr. Shinseki’s replacement. Empty posturing in support of troops and veterans is a staple of political life, and is far easier than actually helping veterans.\n\nThis should not distract anyone from the long list of things that need doing at Veterans Affairs.\n\nIt starts with completing the investigation into what happened at the hospital in Phoenix and, evidently, many other parts of the department’s sprawling health care system. Veterans Affairs’ acting inspector general, Richard Griffin, is on the job: a preliminary report he released on Wednesday showed evidence of wide-scale mismanagement, not just in shutting out 1,700 veterans in Phoenix through fraudulent appointment records but in the “systemic” use of “inappropriate scheduling practices” at hospitals across the country.

Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernard Sanders said in an interview Monday with the Post that politicization of the issue would be \"unconscionable.\" He said representatives of service organizations who testified before his committee last week agreed that VA continues to provide quality health care to veterans. \"Obviously, there's an issue that we must focus on — the issue of access and getting veterans into the system and, very significantly, the issue of waiting times,\" Sanders said. \n\nSanders Supports Veterans: “I hope that the VA scandal makes it clear to anyone paying attention that the very government agency investigating the disgrace, the U.S Congress, is the same agency that denied the proposal by Sen. Sanders to increase VA funding in order to pay for more staff and new facilities. Our Veterans served with valor and honor; they deserve the medical care that they earned,” Andrew Schoerke of Veterans for Peace wrote in a letter to the editor of the Bennington Banner. \n\nVermont Yankee: Sen. Sanders said it's very important that states are involved in all decisions related to decommissioning nuclear power plants. Under current rules, public hearings can be held to take input, but in the end, the operator and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are the only entities that have any real say in how a plant is decommissioned, said Sanders. \"We need to make sure that states that are undergoing decommissioning have a real seat at the table so they can participate in the best way to decommission a plant,” he told the Brattleboro Reformer and Bennington Banner. \n\nCredit Suisse Pleads Guilty in Felony Case: Credit Suisse has done what no other bank of its size and significance has done in over two decades: plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing. In a sign that banking giants are no longer immune from criminal charges, despite concerns that financial institutions have grown so large and interconnected that they are too big to jail, federal prosecutors demanded that Credit Suisse’s parent company plead guilty to helping thousands of American account holders hide their wealth. As part of a deal announced on Monday, the Swiss bank met the demands, agreeing to one count of conspiring to aid tax evasion in a scheme that “spanned decades.” Credit Suisse, which has a giant investment bank in New York and whose chief executive is an American, will also pay about $2.6 billion in penalties and hire an independent monitor for up to two years, The New York Times reported. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/052014","2014-05-20 13:44:05+00","9124187907_10152395086927908",10],[14382,"","2014-05-20 13:41:53+00","9124187907_10152395083687908",10],[14384,"The top 10 corporate tax dodgers: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top-10-corporate-tax-avoiders","2014-05-20 00:15:00+00","9124187907_10152393952937908",10],[14385,"Today's news from Sen.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Senate veterans’ committee chairman, pledged to hold a hearing after the probe is completed into the “very serious” allegations. He stressed, however, that overall the VA provides better care at less cost than private hospitals. He also told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC that some attacks on the VA are rooted in an “anti-government mentality” by critics in a “highly-politicized” Washington. \n\nRecord Road Rebuilding: After a tough winter, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin announced Friday that Vermont will improve 375 miles of state and federal roads and highways as part of the largest paving effort in the state's history. Sen.

In a letter to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Allison Macfarlane, Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and three other senators said the agency that oversees the nation's commercial nuclear industry has been freeing closed plants from certain emergency and security safeguards even though the spent fuel on site remains dangerous for years to come, AP, National Journal, Times Argus and Brattleboro Reformer reported.\n\nTax-Evasion Law Unenforced: The Treasury Department will relax enforcement of a new law aimed at discouraging offshore tax dodging, at least for financial institutions that are making good-faith efforts to comply, The Wall Street Journal reported. The announcement on Friday doesn't postpone the July 1 implementation of the law, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, but the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service won't rigorously enforce many of the law's requirements for 2014 and 2015, as long as firms are trying to cooperate, according to the notice. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/050314","2014-05-03 11:52:14+00","9124187907_10152357417997908",10],[14442,"VIDEO: Sen.

Sanders told Tavis Smiley on PBS during an interview on Monday. On MSNBC, Sanders told Ed Schultz that lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would create jobs and stimulate the economy. “If working people don't have any money to spend because they're earning starvation wages, we're not going to create the types of jobs we have to create” to reduce unemployment, Sanders said. \n\nNet Neutrality: Sen. Sanders’ opposition to new Internet deregulation proposals from the Federal Communications Commission was the hot topic on the popular social media website Reddit last week. Reddit General Manager Erik Martin told The Verge he hopes more political figures will appear on Reddit in opposition to the proposals which would allow Internet providers to divide the web into fast and slow lanes. Sanders has encouraged net neutrality supporters to send their thoughts to FCC, Daily Kos reported. \n\nCitizens United: Extending political rights to corporations unfairly gives greater political representation to corporate owners, Steve Todd said in a letter to The (Harrisburg, Pa.)

Bernie Sanders that would have made clear that states had the legal authority to require labeling, Congressional Quarterly reported. \n\nPfizer Avoids US Taxes: Drugs giant Pfizer will face a grilling today from U.S. shareholders over its takeover bid for Britain’s AstraZeneca. The acquisition is aimed at moving Pfizer’s tax domicile to the United Kingdom in order to deprive U.S. coffers of billions of dollars. Sen. Sanders put Pfizer on a list of ‘Top Ten Corporate Tax Avoiders,’ claiming it paid no income taxes from 2010 to 2012 and that it received $2.2billion of tax refunds from the IRS at the same time as making $43 billion in worldwide profit, London’s Daily Mail reported. \n\nKeystone Pipeline Looms as Senate Takes up Energy Bill: The impassioned debate over the Keystone XL pipeline could reach a tipping point this week on Capitol Hill, with this likely the last chance for the issue to be considered legislatively until after the November midterm elections. The outcome could complicate matters for the Obama administration, which is still reviewing whether to allow permits for sections of the pipeline. The Senate is set to begin debate on a modest energy bill that has enough bipartisan support to pass on its own merits, but supporters of the pipeline, which is intended to transport oil from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast, are trying to leverage the bill to force votes on Keystone, The Washington Post reported. \n\nChina Poised to Overtake US Economy: China is advancing rapidly to overtake the United States as the biggest economy in the world, new data shows, with the leader of the world economy since the 19th century possibly losing its top spot to the Asian giant later this year. \"The United States remained the world's largest economy (in 2011), but it was closely followed by China\" once data was adjusted for comparison on a standard basis, the World Bank said in a report last week.

Bernie Sanders told MSNBC. \n\nPhoenix VA: Department of Veterans Affairs officials told senators Wednesday that the investigation into allegations of a secret waiting list for medical appointments at the Phoenix VA so far has turned up no evidence that such a list exists. Veterans Committee Chairman Sanders vowed to “get to the bottom of what has happened in Phoenix,” while reaching conclusions “based on an objective investigation of the facts — not TV reports.” Sanders said the allegations should not be allowed \"to impugn excellent work done throughout this country by hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses and administrators on all levels” at the VA, The Associated Press reported. \n\nSenate to Vote on Campaign Finance Amendment: A string of Supreme Court decisions, starting in with a 2010 ruling in Citizens United vs. the FEC, enabled the nation's wealthiest donors to anonymously contribute unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. Sen. Chuck Schumer on Wednesday promised to hold a Senate vote this year on a constitutional amendment to allow restrictions on campaign spending. It is unclear if any potential presidential candidates will run on the issue in the 2016 election. So far, only Sen. Sanders has indicated that he would campaign heavily against the influence of big donors and corporate interests in politics, The Boston Globe reported. \n\nEconomy Sputters: The Commerce Department said Wednesday that American gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.1% in the first quarter as weakness overseas hurt exports and frigid weather curtailed business investment, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The credit crisis of 2008 dwarfed earlier financial busts. So far, however, only one junior executive at a Wall Street bank has been sent to prison. In the past, the New York Stock Exchange chief landed in prison after the 1929 crash. Some 1,100 people were prosecuted after the savings-and-loan scandals of the 1980s.

At a June 2013 hearing, Sen.

Sanders wrote in a column published Saturday by The (Willimantic, Conn.) Chronicle. Among the many other areas that Congress must focus on, Sanders listed raising the minimum wage to a living wage, expanding Social Security and addressing the planetary crisis of global warming.\n\nMiddle-Class Americans Live Hand-to-Mouth: A new Brookings Institution study found that two-thirds of U.S. households living \"hand-to-mouth\" are actually middle class, with homes and retirement assets.

That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially,” Sanders said.

Today, about 4 million Americans who are currently looking for a job have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In the wake of a slow recovery from the recession that began in 2007, long-term unemployment is near a 60-year high.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans today oppose extending the benefits, but when George W. Bush was President, Republicans, including Boehner, voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times  Now that Barack Obama is in the White House, many congressional Republicans oppose extending these benefits. Since 1958, Congress has never failed to pass emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment has been as high as it is today. Today, there are nearly three job applicants for every one job opening.  There simply aren’t enough jobs out there for the more than 10 million Americans who are actively seeking work.\n\nThe long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it’s been at any other time Congress has let emergency jobless assistance expire. For example, hundreds of people applied last month to work at a Sam’s Club in Oxford, Ala., that won’t be opening until August. In January, more than 5,000 people waited in line for just 1,500 jobs at an outlet mall in Palm Beach, Fla. That same month, 1,600 people in Hagerstown, Md., applied for just 36 job openings at a dairy farm to process milk and ice cream. Last December, 10,000 people applied for just 750 flight attendant jobs at Southwest Airlines and more than 23,000 Americans applied for just 600 jobs at Wal-Mart in Washington, DC.\n\nIf Congress fails to extend emergency unemployment benefits, 240,000 American workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year. The overall economy will be hurt because when people lose their unemployment benefits, they don’t go to the grocery store, they don’t buy clothes, they don’t go to the pharmacy.

Sanders said in a speech that MSNBC Lawrence O’Donnell cited on Friday night to set up a discussion about a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Charles Koch on why he and his brother David are pouring so much money into right wing political causes and candidates. \"I`m fighting to restore a free society,” Charles Koch wrote. “Instead of welcoming free debate, collectivists engage in character assassination.\"\n\nAfghan Turnout Is High as Voters Defy the Taliban Title: Defying a campaign of Taliban violence that unleashed 39 suicide bombers in the two months before Election Day, Afghan voters on Saturday turned out in such high numbers to choose a new president and provincial councils that polling hours were extended nationwide, in a triumph of determination over intimidation.

The prohibition is similar to language in a Senate bill aimed at closing a pay gap between men and women. That legislation is scheduled for a vote this week, though it is not likely to pass.

The 6.7 percent official unemployment rate was unchanged from February. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially,” Sen.

Sanders told MSNBC on Thursday. The solution, Sanders said, is public funding of elections “so that all candidates have a fair shot at getting elected, and they can be judged by their ideas, by what they're fighting for, and not by the bank accounts of their campaign sponsors.\" Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would undo a series of court rulings and restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to ban corporate contributions and limit individual donations, Vermont Public Radio reported.\n\nCourt Undermines Democracy: Sen.

President Barack Obama, a spokesman said, was “disappointed,” and Sen. Sanders predicted that henceforth, “billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process,” according to a Chicago Tribune editorial. “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Sen. Sanders said in a Rutland Herald and Times Argus editorial.

Pluto comes from the Greek for \"wealth.\" Back in 1917, Theodore Roosevelt said government by a plutocracy is un-American. It took Sen. Sanders to roll both terms into one sentence in a speech railing against domestic spending cuts, he said: \"This is not what democracy looks like.

Also on Tuesday, Sanders was among senators signing a letter sent to President Obama urging him to issue an executive order banning workplace discrimination against gays.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-032114","2014-03-21 22:00:00+00","9124187907_10101567798650789",10],[14588,"Take the poll: Which is a better way to reduce the nation’s deficit?\n\nA) Tax carbon dioxide pollution from big polluters such as oil, gas and other companies.\n\nB) Cut spending on programs like education, Social Security, Medicare and environmental protection.\n\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/climate","2014-03-14 17:11:59+00","9124187907_10152092262357893",10],[15065,"Must Read: A Federal Budget Crisis Months in the Planning - Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Mike McIntire, The New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=1\u0026","2013-10-08 15:30:01+00","9124187907_10151886059887908",10],[15069,"A Political Crisis: http://youtu.be/6LC_4h8rk9E?t=6s","2013-10-07 15:41:55+00","9124187907_10151884052762908",10],[14563,"Heat and Eat: \r\n\r\nVermont and other states have figured out a way to help some seniors and families with children avoid freezing or starving this winter.

Major metro areas have been magnets for both the rich and the poor since ancient times; in fact they owe a great deal of their dynamism to their economic and social diversity. But growing economic segregation—the increasing tendency of affluent people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is affluent, and poor people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is poor—may be a more insidious problem. The emergence of a new urban geography of concentrated wealth and advantage juxtaposed to endemic poverty and concentrated disadvantage poses troubling implications for the economic mobility of people and the economic health of cities.\r\n\r\nJust as lower-skill, higher-pay manufacturing jobs have dropped out of the labor market, and work in America has bifurcated into high-skill, high-paying professional and knowledge occupations and much lower-paying, low-skill service jobs in fields like food service and retail trade, America’s once middle-class neighborhoods have also begun to disappear.\r\n\r\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/the-us-cities-with-the-highest-levels-of-income-segregation","2014-03-19 21:10:55+00","9124187907_10101564699661189",10],[14574,"Today's news from Sen.

The top-line finding for the United States is that the share of pre-tax income going to the top 1 percent of earners continues to be the highest among OECD countries, standing at 19.3 percent in 2012.\n\nThis share has more than doubled since 1980.

The top 10 percent of wage earners are closing in on 50 percent of the pie, while the top 0.1 percent are taking in nearly 10 percent of the income. For some historical context, consider that the 0.1 percent now claim a larger share of income than the 1 percent did in the early '80s, and the 1 percent are now earning nearly as much as the top 5 percent did during the same period.

Obama’s directive to the Labor Department eventually will help millions of low-wage workers. Now, a worker on  salary of more than $455 a week with minimal management duties may be denied overtime.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders applauded the president’s action. “It is absurd that millions of workers making as little as $455 a week are considered ‘supervisors’ and get no overtime pay.  I hope the Department of Labor raises that threshold to at least $1,000, which would reflect inflation since 1975. That step alone would mean a raise for millions of workers. More money in the hands of working people would mean that those workers could then go out and make purchases that would help create more jobs.”\n\nIt will take a while before workers see any more money in their paychecks. Leaving the details to be worked out by the Labor Department, Obama did not specify what the new salary thresholds should be. The department isn’t likely to propose specific language until this fall.\n\nWorkers won the right to overtime pay back in 1938, when Congress passed a law requiring extra pay for extra hours of work. Under the law, the Labor Department was given the authority to change the salary thresholds to account for inflation. The department also was given leeway to spell out which workers are eligible for overtime. The last time the rules were updated, however, was 1975. That’s when the Ford administration raised the salary threshold significantly to account for inflation.","2014-03-13 23:00:00+00","9124187907_10152245475332908",10],[14591,"Childhood Poverty in America:\n\nThe childhood poverty rate in the United States is greater than in any other major country.

Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders criticized the bill as an incomplete fix, The Washington Times, The Hill and The Daily Caller reported. “While it covers the current retirees, it does not cover future retirees who would then have to bear the burden of the COLA cut,” Sanders said. Veterans organizations also raised objections to the exclusion of future retirees. A Sanders bill would repeal the full cuts and expand veterans benefits, Military.com reported.\n\nA Raise for Low-Wage Federal Workers: President Barack Obama signed an executive order to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 for workers employed by federal contractors. Sen. Sanders told Vermont Business Magazine the president’s move “adds momentum to the push in Congress to raise the minimum wage for every worker.” In September, Sanders and 14 other senators sent a letter urging the president to issue the order, according to The Ed Schultz Show. “It was in his State of the Union speech, which I think it was very much to your credit, senator,” Schultz said during the radio interview with Sanders.\n\n#StopTheNSA: Republicans and Democrats united Tuesday in their opposition of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs as part of a national day of activism, The Washington Times reported.

Many Republicans have rallied around a proposal from Sen. Kelly Ayotte that would offset the $6 billion cost by closing the child tax credit to undocumented immigrants. Democrats have ranged from not wanting to offset the legislation, to looking to close offshore tax loopholes as proposed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, to a broader benefits bill from Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders that would rely on savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, National Journal, Marine Corps Times and military.com reported. \n\nVeterans Benefits: Majority Leader Harry Reid plans to bring up legislation from Sen. Sanders that would restore the pension cuts and expand health care and education benefits for veterans using overseas contingency operations funds.

Bernard Sanders returned from a two-day trip to Cuba. Sanders and two other senators met with the Cuban foreign minister and Alan Gross, the imprisoned U.S. aid worker. “The goal is for us to get him out of there as soon as possible,” he said. Sanders, along with Sens. Jon Tester and Heidi Heitkamp, then flew to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, where 155 prisoners with suspected ties to al Qaeda are locked up.

Under legislation by Sen. Sanders, wounded male veterans' spouses would be able to get artificial insemination at VA hospitals, and wounded women could designate surrogate mothers who would be able to receive fertility treatment at the VA, The Washington Times reported.  \"Starting a family is a two-person job,\" said Tom Tarantino, chief policy officer at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \n\nLow-Wage Workers: The number of American workers who are low-wage and low-income earners jumped 94 percent from 1979 to 2011, reaching 20.9 million workers, according to a new study from University of Massachusetts Boston economists Randy Albelda and Michael Carr. That means that 1 in 7 U.S. workers lives in a household whose main source of income is a low-paying job, such as working as a retail sales clerk or a fast-food restaurant cashier.

That situation led the climatologist Daniel Scott, a professor of global change and tourism at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, to analyze potential venues for future Winter Games. His thought was that with a rise in the average global temperature of more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit possible by 2100, there might not be that many snowy regions left in which to hold the Games.

Fifteen senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and 17 members of the House, led by Keith Ellison of Minnesota, sent letters to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority. Currently the federal minimum wage is $7.25. And there's been a push by Democrats to raise it to $10.10 -- an idea that Obama supports. The White House hasn't taken a position on whether Obama would issue an executive order, CNN Money reported. \n\nNSA Surveillance: A federal privacy watchdog panel on Thursday pronounced the National Security Agency archiving of telephone metadata — numbers, times and lengths of calls, but not their content — an invasion of privacy that's of \"limited value\" in counter-terrorism cases.

But, unlike the watchdog group, he did not call for an end to the program. “The president's recommendations last week did not go far enough to rein in the out-of-control National Security Agency,” Sen.

Every January and February, I think about that time, because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed, when fortunes are made.\n\nI’d learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman, a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. “Imagine what life will be like,” he’d say, “when I make a million dollars.” While he dreamed of selling a screenplay, in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom’s nurse-practitioner salary.\n\nDad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22, so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs, high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials, knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

The president also directed America's intelligence agencies to stop spying on friendly international leaders. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been a leading critic of the massive surveillance operations by the NSA. Interviewed afterward on CNN, Sanders said there was a need to balance Americans’ constitutional right against unreasonable searches with the need to thoroughly investigate instances when intelligence or law enforcement agencies have a reasonable suspicion of a potential terrorist plot.\n\nWatch Sen.

Researchers will use the center to test new ways to reduce the cost of solar energy. Shumlin credited Sanders with pushing for the center in Vermont, saying the senator had been “like a dog on a bone to ensure we get the partners together to advance these efforts.” \n\nVeterans Wait for Mental Health Care: Thousands of veterans seeking help for mental health problems are waiting longer to be seen by a counselor than the two weeks that is the government's goal, according to Department of Veterans Affairs data cited by USA Today.  “It is unacceptable that even after the hiring of 1,600 new mental health staff, certain VA facilities remain unable to ... treat veterans in a timely manner,” said Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate veterans’ committee. \n\nYouth Unemployment: What's a bigger problem, youth unemployment or the fact that Social Security will be insolvent in 20 years? To Sen. Sanders, the answer is obvious, with unemployment rates in double digits for America's young people. “You have millions of kids out there who are never getting their feet on the ground in terms of a career…That is a crisis today,” he said in an interview with National Journal about his role as one of 22 senators on the House-Senate conference committee trying to hammer out an agreement on the federal budget. \n\nFree Credit Scores: FICO, owner of the credit-scoring formula most widely used by U.S. lenders, is giving some consumers access to their credit scores for free, even before they apply for a loan.

He said he also was fighting for education, health care and decent wages — all issues that remain important today. “The work of King is something we must never forget,” Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press.  \n\nVeterans Press Congress to Undo Cuts: The $1.1 trillion spending bill Congress passed last week leaves most veterans without relief from cuts in cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees. On Thursday, a group of Republican senators introduced a plan to undo the cuts and extend long-term unemployment benefits. The American Legion endorsed that approach on Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders also introduced a bill on Thursday to address the cost-of-living cuts as well as several other issues that are important to veterans, The Washington Times reported.\n\nVeterans Group Backs Sanders’ Bill: Sen. Sanders’ legislation is already getting some key support. Sen. Harry Reid is expected to fast-track the legislation under Rule 14, which will allow the bill to skip the committee process, and be taken up after the Senate returns from recess, a spokesperson for Sanders said. The Military Officers Association of America came out with some early support for the bill on Friday afternoon, citing the provision to restore the COLA funding, National Journal reported.\n\nWho Will Congress Cut to Support Troops?: By one estimate, one-third of lawmakers have backed a proposal to reserve the COLA cuts to working-age military retirees. But in a budget constrained environment, the money to reverse the cuts has to come from somewhere, and that's where the unity shatters en. Sanders’ omnibus veterans bill deals with a whole swath of issues from restoring the COLA cuts to expanding scholarship funds. And it looks like it could have momentum. Sen. Harry Reid is expected to file the legislation under Rule 14 -- allowing it to skip the committee process, National Journal reported. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/012014","2014-01-20 12:31:37+00","9124187907_10101462035665659",10],[14747,"NSA: Out of Control: \n\nPlease join Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nSanders Bill Would Repeal Military Pension Cut: Congress gave final approval Thursday to a $1.1 trillion spending bill that eases sharp budget cuts known as the sequester and guarantees that the nation will not endure another government shutdown until at least Oct. 1. The Washington Post online said the bill trims pensions for younger military retirees, but added that an omnibus Veterans Affairs bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders awaiting action in the Senate would repeal the cut. Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, said during remarks on the Senate floor Thursday that the measure “delivers on the promises that we have made to our service members.” Sanders told Politico the fix is part of a “comprehensive veterans bill” that he believes will be the “most significant veterans bill passed in several decades.” \n\nNSA Surveillance: President Barack Obama's address on government surveillance Friday will be a key step in his re-examination of post-Sept. 11 security practices. In a letter responding to questions raised by Sen. Sanders, National Security Agency head Gen. Keith Alexander said the agency does not \"spy\" on members of Congress but he did not rule out the collection of metadata from members of Congress, Vermont Public Radio and Truthout reported. \"In my view,” Sanders said, “the information collected by the NSA has the potential to give an unscrupulous administration enormous power over elected officials.\" \n\nNetwork News Ignores Climate Change: Sen. Bernie Sanders and other members of a new congressional task force on climate change took network television bosses to task over their lack of coverage on global warming last year, Politico, The Huffington Post and Media Matters for America reported.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nReal Unemployment at 13.1% in December: U.S. employers added a scant 74,000 jobs in December, the fewest in three years. The disappointing gain ends 2013 on a weak note. The Labor Department announced on Friday that the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008, but The Associated Press noted that the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. Counting those frustrated job hunters and those forced to settle for part-time work, the real unemployment figure for December was 13.1 percent, unchanged from the month before. \n\nUnemployment Extension: Negotiations over the extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless suffered a major setback in the Senate on Thursday, as competing plans to pay the costs of the extension began to emerge. Democrats offered a roughly $18 billion proposal that would extend the benefits through most of 2014, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid scheduled a showdown vote Monday. Democrats need at least five GOP senators to cross the aisle and support the plan, but they appear to lack the support of several of the key six Republicans who previously supported advancing the bill and have now said they are very likely to vote against the new proposal. The federal law that provides benefits to the long-time unemployed expired on Dec. 28, The Washington Post reported.\n\nGlobal Warming Task Force: Senate Democrats plan to set up a global warming task force to revive the issue in Congress and help President Obama achieve the goals set out in his climate agenda. Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sheldon Whitehouse told reporters on Thursday that they would launch the task force with more than a dozen members. Boxer chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. With Sen. Bernie Sanders, she introduced a bill to tax carbon dioxide emissions and use the funds to support renewable energy development, The Daily Caller reported. \n\nIndependent America: Forty-two percent of Americans identify themselves as political independents.

Bernie Sanders called Tuesday’s 60-37 Senate vote “an important victory.” He said “it makes both moral and economic sense to help people looking for work,” the Bennington Banner reported. \n\nWar on Poverty: In the 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson called in a State of the Union address for a \"War on Poverty,\" Democrats have distanced themselves from discussions about class and inequality. But today Democrats are rolling out a political agenda smaller in scale than Johnson's but equally as ambitious in today's partisan landscape. “There is a greater perception in this country that the middle class continues to decline, that we have more people living in poverty today than we do ever in the history of the United States and our childhood unemployment rate is the highest in the industrial world,\" says Sen. Sanders told U.S. News \u0026 World Report. “Reality has forced many Democrats to seize the issue. When you have more wealth and income inequality today than any time since the 1920s, it is very hard to avoid the issue.” \n\nVeterans’ Benefits: Senior Democrats on Tuesday signaled they could support a deal to repeal $6 billion in military retirement benefit cuts. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hinted Tuesday that the military pension reductions included in last month’s budget deal could get reversed in the omnibus spending bill to fund the government. A bill by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has 18 Democrat co-sponsors as well the backing of Sanders, Military.com reported. “You make a promise to veterans and that promise should be kept,” Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders told The Wall Street Journal. \n\nNSA Spying: Vermont’s independent senator wants to know if the National Security Agency has been ‘‘spying’’ on members of Congress.

Obama seemed open to it, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview afterward with The Associated Press. “They are taking a hard look at it.” Sens. Sanders and Sherrod Brown “expressed particular delight with the president’s focus on the minimum wage,” according to Politico. \n\nClimate Change: Climate change got more coverage on broadcast news in 2013 than in the previous few years, but the issue still didn't get nearly as much attention as it did in 2009. Media Matters found in a new analysis that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox Sunday morning programs together devoted only 27 minutes to climate change for the entire year. \"Face the Nation\" was the first Sunday show in five years to feature scientists discussing climate change. Sens. Sanders and Brian Schatz announced earlier this week that they are launching an effort to pressure television networks to devote more time to covering climate change, The Huffington Post reported. \n\nGlobal Warming: Sen. Sanders and other senators formed a climate change task force this week aimed at bringing the issue to the foreground in 2014, Bloomberg BNA and the Akron Beacon Journal reported. Members of the group are signing a letter from Sens. Sanders and Schatz to America’s major media outlets asking them to stop ignoring global warming, according to American Thinker and Politix. Sanders wants “the major networks to become a forum for uncontested green propaganda,” Investor’s Business Daily editorialized. \n\nNSA: President Obama will preserve much of the existing Natural Security Agency surveillance program established under President Bush but make modest changes to domestic spying programs which have drawn widespread criticism. Sen. Sanders, one of the National Security Agency's \"chief critics,\" called for far-reaching reforms to ensure Americans' privacy rights are protected. “What we have to do is to make sure that at a time of exploding technology that we figure out ways to make sure that the government does not know about all of your phone calls, your emails and websites,\" Sanders told CNN on Wednesday in a report broadcast on WGNO-TV in New Orleans and other affiliates nationwide.

Bernie Sanders told Alex Wagner on MSNBC.  \n\nNSA: The National Security Agency asserted that the government is not spying on lawmakers, but Gen. Keith Alexander said in a letter to Sen. Sanders that the agency can make no guarantee that members of Congress have not had their “telephone metadata” caught up in broad government sweeps, according to the CNN, USA Today online, Time magazine online, the Burlington Free Press, Brattleboro Reformer, The Huffington Post, The Hill, Slate and The Blaze and WJXT-TV in Jacksonville, Fla. “Translation: Yes, we are spying on you,” radio host Bill Press said. Members of Congress “are under the same microscope as everyone else,\" according to an editorial in the Springfield, Mass., Republican. \n\nClimate Change: Senators on Tuesday unveiled a congressional task force to more aggressively fight climate change, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer have unveiled comprehensive legislation to impose fees on carbon pollution with rebates for consumers, according to KPCC-FM in Los Angeles. One of the first efforts from members of the climate group will be a letter from Sanders and Sen. Brian Schatz asking major television networks to stop ignoring global warming, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. \"Sunday news shows devoted all of eight minutes in 2012 to coverage of climate change issues, which is a decrease from nine minutes the year before,” Sanders told The Hill and National Journal, citing analysis from Media Matters for America. \n\nObama and Global Warming: Senate Democrats will meet with President Obama Wednesday night to discuss 2014 priorities, and climate change may be on the docket, according to Politico. “There is a growing concern among many of us that the planetary crisis, global warming, has not been emphasized and dealt with as strongly and effectively as it might, so I would not be surprised if that issue came up,” said Sen.

Of the 365 federal solar applications since 2009, just 20 plants are on track to be built. Only three large-scale solar facilities have gone online, two in California and one in Nevada.

The measure’s fate remained in doubt because six Republicans who voted Tuesday to bring an unemployment bill to the Senate floor ended the week angry that they were shut out of negotiations on how to offset the cost of the benefits with spending cuts elsewhere or with new revenue. \"What these offsets will be is taking money from Peter to pay Paul,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz Friday on MSNBC. The senator noted that under President George W. Bush, Republicans voted for five extensions of emergency unemployment without any offsets.\n\nUnemployment: A Bennington Banner editorial praised Sen.Sanders for fighting for a three-month extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. \"At a time of growing wealth and income inequality, we cannot turn our backs on 1.3 million people who would be left out in the cold without this help,\" said Sanders.\n\nIBM Workers: The state and federal departments of labor are seeking input from workers laid off last year at the Essex Junction IBM facility to support their inclusion in a federal training and reemployment program for workers who have lost jobs due to foreign competition.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed a procedural vote on a three-month bill to buy time for negotiations over an offset. “I could live with that,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said of offsets during an interview Wednesday on The Ed Schultz Show. If Republicans want offsets, Sanders said, Congress could come up with the money to pay for the benefits by reining in corporate tax dodgers or cutting wasteful military programs. \n\nUnemployment Insurance: “While there has been some modest improvement in the overall economy, there still are three job applicants for every job opening … As Sen. Sanders has noted, unemployment insurance kept 2.5 million Americans, including 600,000 children, out of poverty in 2012. … Now is not the time to turn our backs on the long-term unemployed,” the Bennington Banner editorialized. \n\nGlobal Warming: “The scientific community, those responsible for protecting our national security, the American public and corporations increasingly are recognizing that climate change is happening now and that carbon pricing is likely to be part of the solution.

Sanders said on WCAX-TV on Monday.

There is no program which protects working families -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, affordable housing, etc. -- that they don't want to cut.\n\nBut the Democrats (with whom I caucus as an Independent) are most certainly not without fault. In the Senate, they have tolerated Republican obstructionism for much too long and allowed major legislation to fail for lack of 60 votes.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nCongress Readies a Year-End Dash: Congress gets a late chance this week to end the year with an elusive budget deal and to make headway on other fronts. In the final week of 2013 that the Senate and House are scheduled to be in Washington at the same time, lawmakers and aides are optimistic that negotiators can reach a budget accord and continue to make progress on a farm bill and other measures. Meanwhile, a Senate rule change pushed through by Democrats should help ease the way for confirmation of several of President Obama's executive-branch and judicial nominees, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBudget Deal Near: House and Senate negotiators were putting the finishing touches Sunday on what would be the first successful budget accord since 2011, when the battle over a soaring national debt first paralyzed Washington. The deal expected to be sealed this week on Capitol Hill would not significantly reduce the debt, now $17.3 trillion and rising. It would not close corporate tax loopholes or reform expensive health-care and retirement programs. It would not even fully replace sharp spending cuts known as the sequester, the negotiators’ primary target, The Washington Post reported.\n\nCell Phone Tracking: Cellphone carriers last year answered at least 1.1 million requests from law enforcement agencies seeking information on caller locations, text messages and other data for use in investigations, according to reports from the carriers in response to a request from Sen.

He called climate change “the issue of our day,” but said government has been slow to respond. “If we’re going to transform our energy system, it’s not going to come from Washington or Paris or London, it’s going to come from the grassroots and people knocking on doors,” he added in the Valley News.\n\nSingle Payer: The biggest downside of the Affordable Care Act is the reliance on the private insurance industry. It does not have to be this way, however. The law includes a provision that can open the door for states to institute their own single-payer healthcare system.

Sanders wants to bring more veterans into the Veterans Affairs health system by expanding eligibility for dental and health services.

In a radio interview on The Ed Schultz Show, Sanders said the president and the public should put real pressure on the “do-nothing” Congress to take action.\n\nCommunity Health Centers: Sen. Sanders announced Wednesday that three new community health centers will come to the state in Arlington, Bristol and Randolph. The centers provide both medical and dental care. Nearly 160,000 Vermonters, one-quarter of the state’s total population, utilize the health center network giving Vermont one of the highest participation rates in the country, Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. “If American moves as aggressively as Vermont does, the health care outcomes will be a hell of a lot better and we think we’re going to save money as well,” Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio.

Ellison said the bill would cut tax breaks, close loopholes and end taxpayer-funded fossil fuel research. This is a long shot, despite estimated savings of $100 billion-plus over 10 years, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The fossil fuel lobby helped end some ethanol subsidies. Ethanol blends accounts for about 10 percent of U.S. gasoline sales.

Bernie Sanders. The House that summer was considering a bill to allow commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies to merge by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. Sanders predicted that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would lead to fewer banks and financial service providers; increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses; diminished credit for rural America and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. “It will lead to more mega-mergers; a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry; and further concentration of economic power in our country,” Sanders said.

Both publications noted that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer floated a bill with Sen. Sanders.

Sanders’ coalition to protect Social Security and Medicare has gathered nearly 500,000 petition signatures in a matter of days. “To put into context how successful this petition drive has been, it took months and a national television advertising campaign for Ted Cruz’s defund Obamacare petition to get to 2 million signatures,” Jason Easley wrote for Politicususa.\n\nSave Social Security: Polls show that Democrats, Republicans and independents overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, but people like the Koch brothers believe in a very different kind of America. They want Congress to end or drastically reduce government involvement in retirement programs (Social Security) and health care (Medicare and Medicaid) while also giving more tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Sunday by the Burlington Free Press. \n\nSave Social Security: Sen. Sanders of Vermont is leading the opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Sanders is working with many groups to try and find a way to balance the budget without taking away from working families and the poor. \"At a time when the number of people living in poverty in our country is at an all-time high, we must not cut programs which provide basic security to tens of millions of our people who are struggling economically,” Sanders said in a Sunday morning report on WPTZ-TV.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/110313","2013-11-03 15:49:52+00","9124187907_10151947712937908",10],[14959,"Sign up to receive updates from Sen.

Bernie Sanders was named to a committee to try and create a long-term budget plan by Dec. 13 and prevent another government shutdown. “It’s important to have Sen. Sanders on that committee to make certain they make the right choices going forward and we don’t end up in this mess all over again in January,” Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin told WPTZ-TV on Saturday. “I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to end the absurdity of sequestration and to develop a budget which works for all Americans,” Sanders said in a report posted byvtdigger.org.  \n\nSanders in the South: Sen. Sanders' visit Saturday to St. Helena's Island resulted in something rare in the conservative Lowcountry: a self-described socialist receiving a standing ovation. Sanders told more than 150 people at the S.C. Progressive Network fall retreat that \"white, working-class people in the South\" have a tendency \"to vote against themselves.\" The longest-serving independent in Congress visited South Carolina after stops in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi in an effort to unite progressives and working- and middle-class conservatives, The Beufort Gazette, The Associated Press and Raw Story reported. \n\nObama Wins Standoff with Congress: President Obama trounced the Republicans last week with a strategy of holding firm and winning an argument, not by finding common ground. Obama has proved better at the messy business of helping hold together his own party's congressional caucus than President Bill Clinton did. “For all the talk of Obama's distaste for schmoozing, he was the one who finally passed a health care law by holding together every single Senate Democrat, from Bernie Sanders on the left to Ben Nelson on the right,” according to The New York Times.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/102013","2013-10-20 12:53:47+00","9124187907_10151911321082908",10],[15012,"Sign up to get news from Sen.

Writing for The Huffington Post, Jason Linkins said Sanders’ appointment ensures Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries will have “one strong, supportive voice in the room.\" Jason Easley at Politicususa said Sanders “has long been an outspoken critic of the Ryan budgets, and the Wisconsin Republican’s borderline obsession with privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare.”\n\nSanders Goes South: On a four-day swing through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, Sen.

The estimate that the typical retiree is in line for only a $17 a month raise, one of the smallest increases ever, was made by The Associated Press. The projection comes at a time when congressional Republicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, have used the government shutdown as leverage to renew their push to cut benefits even more. The Republicans and some Democrats want to change how inflation is calculated by adopting a so-called chained consumer price index.

Senate Democrats on Monday plan to table the Republican measures.

Ahead of an important Senate vote to reopen the government, Sanders video conferenced with a town-hall meeting in Jackson, Misss. \"If you don't get involved in the conservative states, they'll never be battleground states in the future,\" Sanders told the audience, according to the Jackson Free Press. \n\nThe Playboy Interview: Like Martin Luther King Jr., Jimmy Carter and Steve Jobs before him, Sen.

President Barack Obama signed the measure that made virtually no concessions on the health care law that was the reason Republicans started the fiscal crisis. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the resolution “a major political victory” but cautioned in a late-night interview on MSNBC that continued spending cuts contained in the stopgap bill are “a disaster.”  He said he was glad that for now the \"nightmare\" was over, The Associated Press, Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, Rutland Herald, Seven Days and The Washington Times reported. \n\nSanders Named to Budget Conference: Sen. Sanders was appointed to a conference committee to try to reconcile separate budget documents passed by the House and Senate this year. “I look forward to the negotiations that will take place,” Sanders said on MSNBC. “The time is long overdue that we stood up for the working families of this country, for the children and for the elderly and not move toward deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable people,\" Sanders said in a floor speech on WCAX-TV. \n\nThe Agenda Ahead: The shutdown and the crisis atmosphere it created kept Congress from doing the work it should have been doing all along. “There are enormous issues facing this country. The middle class is disappearing. Poverty is at an all-time high. We're not even beginning to address the international crisis of global warming or our crumbling infrastructure or extremely high unemployment,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts in an interview earlier Wednesday on MSNBC. \n\nThe Next Fight: With the government re-opening and default averted, larger budget battles over entitlements and sequestration lie ahead. “When you have the Koch brothers, who sit on $71 billion, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process, trust me this battle has not ended,” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Rev. Al Sharpton. “Our job is to bring the working people, the middle class of this country, together to stand up to the big money interests who want to repeal every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years to protect ordinary Americans.”\n\nTea Party Damaged America: Sen. Sanders said in a Senate floor speech Wednesday that Tea Party Republicans had severely damaged the country, The Hill reported online. The country has suffered a black eye in the world community, Sanders told the Vermont Press Bureau. “How can you proclaim to be the leading power in the world, the country that others are supposed to look up to, when you can’t even keep your government open and you can’t pay your bills?” Sanders asked.  “The United States’ position in the world has been severely damaged by this,” he added.

Senate leaders were blindsided Tuesday by news that House Republicans were moving forward on competing legislation, but that effort fizzled when Speaker John Boehner failed to pick up enough votes from right-wing Republicans. “The Republican House these guys cannot agree on anything so it is a bit of a frightening situation,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. Sanders doesn’t like it that the Senate compromise that was in the works would solve the problem for only a few months, but he told VPR, “I am willing to back off of that and say, 'Alright, we have to avert the crisis right now in front of us.’” \n\nSanders Sees a Way Out: “Let’s take a deep breath,” Sen. Sanders told CNN on Tuesday. \"What I hope and expect happens is in the 12th hour, Boehner looks his right-wing extremists in the eye and says 'Look guys, I have gone as far as I can with you. I cannot allow a default to take place. I cannot allow this entire world's economy to go into recession. We're going to work with the Democrats. We're going to pass what the Senate has brought us.’ And that's the way out.”\n\nBudget Conference: Whenever the dust settles on the debt and government shutdown crises, the House and Senate appear likely to embark on a new round of budget talks under the auspices of a now-rare bicameral conference committee. Sen. Sanders is on the Budget Committee and could be among the negotiators pushing for new tax money. “One out of four corporations in this country does not pay any federal income taxes,” Sanders told Roll Call. “Clearly, that’s an absurdity that has to be addressed and be part of that negotiation.”\n\nBorder Crossing Delays: Sen. Sanders hosted an August meeting with Vermont state officials and business interests to urge Customs and Border Protection management to address staff shortages that have resulted in long lines and frustrating delays entering the United States. “It’s from both an economic point of view and a security point of view not a good situation,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/101613","2013-10-16 13:08:34+00","9124187907_10151903122737908",10],[15032,"The Way Out: \n\nWith the clock ticking, Sen.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said leaders had made \"tremendous progress\" toward a deal and that he was hopeful Tuesday would be a \"bright day.\" The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seconded Mr. Reid's optimism. The White House postponed a planned afternoon meeting of congressional leaders with President Barack Obama, saying the schedule change would give Senate leaders time to hash out a deal. The latest proposal would reopen the government at current spending levels until Jan. 15 and extend the federal borrowing limit until early February, according to The Wall Street Journal. \n\nSenate Nears Fiscal Deal: Sen. Bernie Sanders was optimistic on Monday as prospects for ending a two-week-old government shutdown and extending the nation’s debt limit seemed to take a positive turn, WCAX-TV reported. “I am pleased that, finally, the Senate Republican leadership understands that this crisis must be resolved.” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.  Sanders stressed that Senate Democrats already made a huge concession in agreeing to continue across-the-board spending cuts, he said in an MSNBC interview cited by The Washington Times.  \n\nIs a 1.5% COLA Too Generous?: With Social Security and veterans’ benefits expected to go up by only 1.5 percent in January, congressional Republicans and some Democrats would cut future benefits by changing how inflation is calculated. Sen. Sanders warned that adopting a so-called chained consumer price index would cut future benefits, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported. He told WCAX-TV that he wouldn’t support cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid as part of any deal to reopen the government.The Senate veterans’ committee chairman said he finds it \"incomprehensible that any serious person would believe that a 1.5 percent COLA is too generous,” Common Dreams and The Reno Dispatch reported. \n\nThe Next Citizens United: The Supreme Court is weighing a decision to throw out aggregate donor limits on individual campaign contributions, which would inevitably increase the amount of money from high-dollar donors flowing political candidates' campaigns, Amy Goodman wrote for Truthout.

The stalemate began Oct. 1 over House Republican demands to gut the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work, the House shifted course last week and tried to use the shutdown as an excuse to cut Social Security. (The Associated Press reported on Sunday that next year’s cost-of-living adjustment, even with no change in the law, will probably be only  1.5 percent, one of the lowest ever. It’s not certain because the workers who crunch the inflation numbers have been furloughed.) The budget negotiations on Sunday reportedly focused on  how long the government should be funded and for how long.  The Senate also took steps to reconsider a vote on Saturday when Republicans, voting in lockstep, blocked consideration of a resolution to let the government continue to pay its bills.  Sen. Bernie Sanders worried that a default would spike interest rates on home mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards, but he said on Saturday that he believes  Wall Street and big-money interests would not let “the crazies” force the country into a default that could send the economy into a tailspin.\n\nRead the AP report on Social Security COLAs: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/social-security-raise-to-be-among-lowest-in-years\n\nTake the poll on cutting the safety net: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling","2013-10-13 23:18:57+00","9124187907_10151898088332908",10],[15043,"Today's news from Sen.

It is not a major ask that the United States government pays its bills,” Sanders added on MSNBC.\n\nDeadbeat Nation: “It's becoming increasingly possible that for the first time in the history of our country the United States will become a deadbeat nation, precipitating a national and international financial crisis,” Sen.

Sen. Sanders, who supports limits for campaign contributions, attended the argument in the court's latest major campaign finance case, according to The Associated Press and Congressional Quarterly. “If we do not want to move this nation to a form of society where a handful of billionaires can determine the outcome of these elections, then it is imperative not only we overturn Citizens United, but we put a lid on how much people can contribute in elections,” Sanders said in a speech outside the court that aired on C-SPAN and excerpted on Democracy Now.

A copy of his testimony was obtained by The Washington Post. Shinseki will testify that if the shutdown continues into late October, compensation payments to more than 3.8 million veterans will not be made in November. “These include thousands of veterans who have the most severe disabilities,” he said in his advance testimony.

In fact, some 20 House Republicans have signaled that they would support a so-called clean resolution and vote with House Democrats to reopen the government “Bring it to a vote, let's find out what's happening,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.\n\nThird, the shutdown strategy was planned and paid for by the Koch brothers and other wealthy individuals who want to defund the Affordable Care Act, cut Social Security benefits, end Medicare as we know it, abolish the minimum wage and cut other programs that help working families. Their attitude, Sanders said, is “to use every ounce of leverage, even if it means catastrophic pain for America and the world, so long as we get our way.” He cited a Sunday New York Times expose that detailed how the Koch brothers and others plotted the shutdown “from the day after Obama was re-elected.”\n\nThe Koch Brothers: http://youtu.be/fNj8bpY2PEY","2013-10-08 00:27:37+00","9124187907_10101260158743629",10],[15068,"What do you think?

Bernie Sanders is cosponsoring a bill to make sure furloughed federal workers get paid retroactively. That's what happened following federal shutdowns in 1995 and ’96, WCAX-TV reported. The Vermont Labor Department had received 84 requests as of Wednesday from federal workers seeking unemployment benefits. If Sanders’ bill passes, any unemployment benefits would have to be returned, the Burlington Free Press reported. \n\nShutdown: In back-to-back speeches on the Senate floor, Sen. Patrick Leahy decried the Republicans’ “bumper-sticker politics,” while Sen. Sanders said “what this debate is about is blackmail and hostage taking,\" Seven Days reported. Sanders said caving in to Republican demands would embolden them to attempt similar tactics on other issues. “If we surrender right now to these guys on this issue, they will be back,” Raw Story reported. \n\nEnormous Issues Ignored: Congress needs to concentrate on the reason people elected them, Sen. Sanders told WPTZ-TV on Wednesday. “Right now what the American people are asking us to do is to address the enormous amount of problems facing working families in this country. Unemployment is too high. Wages are too low. People can’t afford to send their kids to college. We have an infrastructure that’s falling apart.  We have to deal with energy efficiency. We have to deal with global warming.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \n\nNo End in Sight to Government Shutdown: Lawmakers and the White House dug in Tuesday for a long fight as the first federal government shutdown in nearly two decades showed no signs of breaking. The closure, triggered by a congressional fight over President Obama’s health care law, means 800,000 federal workers were off the job on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said shutdown effects ranged from cancer patients not getting care they need to FBI agents are not reporting to work. Seventeen out of 30 staffers who work for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders are off the job today, the Burlington Free Press reported. \n\nNo Surrender, Sanders Says: The process of closing down large parts of the U.S. government was under way on Tuesday after frantic rounds of late-night political sparring failed to avert the first federal shutdown in nearly two decades. Democrats in Congress hold Republicans to blame for using underhand methods to overturn a health care law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court and endorsed by voters at the last presidential election. “If we surrender to hostage-taking tonight,” Sen. Sanders said in The Guardian, “these guys would be back within a couple of weeks without a shadow of a doubt. What we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinary anti-democratic act.” \n\nHostage Crisis: “People may disagree about the Affordable Care Act, but it is wrong for right-wing Republicans to ignore the results of the last election and hold the American people hostage by threatening to shut down the government unless they get their way,” Sen. Sanders said in the St. Albans Messenger. \n\nClosure Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating.” In Vermont, passport offices like one in St. Albans could close, people applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays, programs to help small businesses and Head Start might shut down, and people applying for Social Security, Medicare and veterans’ benefits will face a significantly slower process, the Bennington Banner reported. The same article said Gov. Peter Shumlin expects only minor disruptions. \n\nAmericans are ‘Disgusted’: In an interview with WPTZ-TV, Sanders said “people are angry, they're upset and they're frustrated. They have every reason to be. What people want is for Congress to address the issues that are facing the American people and that's creating jobs and raising the minimum wage, dealing with the affordability of college and they're disgusted by what they're seeing.” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV that House Republicans are “holding the American people hostage.” \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100213","2013-10-02 13:32:32+00","9124187907_10151873617077908",10],[15095,"Republicans are saying the same things about the Affordable Care Act as they said about Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965: http://youtu.be/3lMsurGlXJI","2013-10-01 19:20:44+00","9124187907_10151872055807908",10],[15100,"Senate Votes Again to Avoid Shutdown: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-votes-again-to-avoid-shutdown\r\nTake the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll","2013-09-30 19:26:28+00","9124187907_10151869922797908",10],[15102,"Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \n\nGovernment Heads Toward Shutdown: The nation braced for a partial shutdown of the federal government, as time for Congress to pass a budget before a Monday midnight deadline grew perilously short and lawmakers gave no signs Sunday they were moving toward a resolution. Leaders of both parties said they wanted to avoid the first federal closure since 1996, but their public appearances seemed aimed more at affixing blame for the impasse, The Wall Street Journal reported. \n\nShutdown Nears: The U.S. government appeared on Sunday to be on the verge of shutting down for the first time in nearly two decades as House leaders were running out of time and options to keep it open. University of Maryland political scientist Roy Meyers suggested Republican leadership probably doesn’t want to relive the last government shutdown when Republicans were blamed more than President Clinton for the shutdowns. Thirty-six senators, including then-Rep. Bernie Sanders, experienced the 1995-96 shutdowns compared to just 20 percent of House members. “I would be surprised if any of them would want to repeat the experience,” Meyers told The Hill. \n\nLow-Wage Workers: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy are among 15 senators who signed a letter to President Obama calling for workers in companies that get federal contracts to be paid at least $10.10 per hour. They urged the president to issue an executive order that would essentially set a minimum wage for federal contractors, WPTZ-TV reported on Monday. \n\nHealth Care: Obama administration officials scrambled to get insurance marketplaces open on Tuesday. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act is expected to proceed even if the government partially shuts down. Sen. Sanders called the new law a welcome but small step. A single-payer system, like Medicare, is a fairer and more efficient way to give all Americans health care, Sanders wrote in a column for The Guardian.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/093013","2013-09-30 13:36:30+00","9124187907_10151869319897908",10],[15077,"Today's news from Sen.

Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. \"We did that in order to get [House Speaker John] Boehner to agree to avoid a shutdown.\"\n\nFurloughed Workers Want Shutdown to End: Federal workers rallied outside of the Capitol on Friday to demand an end to the shutdown that has furloughed federal workers. Sen. Sanders spoke at the rally, MSNBC, WCAX-TV and Politico reported. Sanders told the crowd that the House would vote for a bill to reopen the government if only the speaker would allow a vote. \"If Mr. Boehner brought that bill to the floor it would pass tomorrow. That's what he has got to do. Let's put our people back to work. Let democracy rule,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News. \n\nVermont Senators Back Guard Pay: Sen. Sanders wrote to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel expressing support for National Guard and reserve members to be treated like other military personnel and continue receiving pay during the shutdown, Roll Call, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.\n\nSanders Backs Veterans Benefits: Democrats have gone along with a few carve-outs to the shutdown, most notably agreeing to pay military salaries, but for the most part they have refused to entertain bills to open war memorials, fund the NIH, fund the veterans department and take other steps to reopen specific federal functions. Sen. Sanders has argued in favor of a bill funding veterans’ programs, but other Democrats say they must stand unified against what they have called GOP \"gimmicks,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100513","2013-10-05 13:10:00+00","9124187907_10151879695347908",10],[15079,"Weigh in by taking the latest poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll","2013-10-04 20:20:01+00","9124187907_10151878528162908",10],[15081,"Weigh in by taking the latest poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll","2013-10-04 16:49:36+00","9124187907_10151878175217908",10],[15084,"Playing with Fire: \n\nThree days into a government shutdown, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Thursday that House Speaker John Boehner could break the impasse by letting the House vote on a Senate-passed resolution to fund the government.  Enough Republicans, weary of their own Tea Party fringe, would join Democrats and pass the bill. But Boehner so far has stood with  the far-right group that forced the government shutdown in the first place over a crusade to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Sanders voiced concern that the same tactics by the same small band of extremists could have more dire consequences if the nation’s debt ceiling isn’t raised by mid-October. (The debt ceiling is the amount the government may borrow to pay its bills.) Unless the ceiling is raised, the United States, for the first time in history, could default on its obligations and become “a deadbeat nation,” Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. “These guys,” the senator warned, “are playing with absolute fire.”\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/playing-with-fire","2013-10-04 00:40:01+00","9124187907_10151876576872908",10],[15086,"What do you think?

Sen. Bernie Sanders called the House attempt to undo Obamacare by closing the government “a precedent for blackmail that we cannot allow,” Vermont Public Radio reported. During an eleventh-hour interview on MSNBC, Sanders said Americans are “profoundly disgusted” because “a handful of right-wing extremists are trying to annul, do away with, the election results of a year ago. They haven’t quite caught on that Obama won.” \n\nDevastating Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating” to Vermont and America. He said passport offices like one in St. Albans could close. People applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays. Programs to help small businesses and Head Start might eventually shut down, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported. “People who are to be applying for Social Security … Medicare …veterans’ benefits are going to have that process significantly slowed down,” Sanders added on WPTZ-TV. \n\nSanders: Shield Veterans: Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, introduced legislation Monday evening that would continue Department of Veterans Affairs funding for benefits and pensions even in the event of a protracted shutdown, The Washington Post and Military Times reported. Veterans also could experience significant delays when applying for new disability, education, pay and pension benefits, Sanders said in the Valley News. \n\nHealth Insurance Markets Open: Millions of Americans on Tuesday will begin shopping on the insurance marketplaces at the heart of President Obama's health care reforms. Sen. Sanders supported the Affordable Care Act but said the long-term solution to America's health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program. “The good news is that, in fact, a large scale single-payer system already exists in the United States and its enrollees love it.

If a shutdown continues, it would be devastating for seniors who are on the Meals on Wheels program,” he added. The impasse continued because House Republicans insisted on defunding or delaying Obamacare as part of any deal to avert a shutdown.

The negative vote in Parliament was a heavy blow to Prime Minister David Cameron, who had pledged his support to Obama and called on lawmakers to endorse Britain’s involvement in a brief operation to punish the government of President Bashar al-Assad for apparently launching a deadly chemical weapons attack last week that killed hundreds, The New York Times reported. \n\nIrene Recovery\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide funding to replace much of a state office complex in Waterbury which was destroyed two years ago by Tropical Storm Irene. An agreement was reached with the Federal Emergency Management Agency that will provide nearly $90 million of the $125 million dollar price tag for the new complex.

Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Chris Jansing that the Republican effort to defund President Obama’s signature health care legislation would only be the beginning of their right-wing agenda. “Getting rid of Obamacare is nickels and dimes.

The U.S. is the \"only nation in the entire industrial world that doesn't guarantee health care as a right,\" Sanders said on CNN's Crossfire. He called the Affordable Care Act a “good Republican program,” referring to the Massachusetts program by former governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. \n\nBudget Standoff: Congressional Republicans are threatening a government shutdown on Tuesday in their effort to defund President Barack Obama's health care law. “It’s not going to happen,” Sen.

Interviewed Tuesday on The Bill Press Show, Sanders cited a new Census Bureau report that showed median family income today is less than it was 24 years ago and an increase in poverty. “The idea of punishing millions of Americans by radically cutting back on food stamps, by radically cutting back on the needs of people who are on the Meals on Wheels program … is absolutely crazy,” Sanders said.\n\nWorkers Protest: Cleaning and concessions workers plan to walk off their jobs in federal buildings Wednesday and march on the White House, where they’ll demand President Obama wield his executive authority to raise labor standards for their taxpayer-funded jobs.

Bernie Sanders told the Burlington Free Press. “It is also wrong to force many federal workers to take furloughs – resulting in significant cuts in pay.” \n\nBullies: Sen. Sanders on Monday criticized a House-passed bill that would cut nutrition programs by $39 billion. “What you’re talking about is the incredible cruelty and arrogance of a party representing the wealthy and the powerful to punish the poor and working people,” Sanders said. “These are bullies who are beating up on helpless people … They don’t impress me.” Sanders told MSNBC's Martin Bashir. \n\nOff the Deep End: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday said a shutdown would “make the United States look incredibly stupid throughout the world” and the threat by Republicans to close the government unless they get their way “makes every American ask, ‘What in god’s name is going on in Washington.’” At a time of massive poverty and falling incomes for middle-class, working families, Sanders said on The Bill Press Show that cutting food stamps, Head Start, Meals on Wheels and other programs is an “absolutely crazy” idea pushed by right-wing Republicans “going off the deep end.” \n\nThe Fed: Few remember that 30 senators voted against Ben Bernanke when President Barack Obama nominated him for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2010, Juan Williams wrote for The Hill.

Sanders listed some of the effects of sequestration: 57,000 children knocked off Head Start; tens of thousands of seniors dropped from Meals on Wheels; cuts to housing assistance for the elderly and disabled; work-study programs cut for 70,000 college students; cancer patients losing Medicare treatments, and 400,000 elderly and other low-income households losing heating assistance this winter. \n\nTax Scam: Sen. Sanders is among 12 senators calling on the Justice Department to investigate tax-lien programs that in Washington, D.C. alone have cost dozens of families their homes.

The share of people living alone, meanwhile, rose 10 percentage points, to 27 percent.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), The Huffington Post: \n\nAt a time of great political division in our country President Obama has found a remarkable way to unite Americans of all political persuasions -- conservatives, progressives and moderates. With a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria's bloody and complicated civil war.\n\nThere are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.'s military intervention in Syria.\n\nFirst, of course, is the much discussed \"war weariness.\" The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years, and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years. The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6,700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care. Further, as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.\n\nBut there's another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years. And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.\n\nHere's the truth. The middle class in this country is collapsing. The number of Americans living in poverty is nearly the highest on record and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And very few people in Washington give a damn.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/the-american-people-have_b_3916584.html","2013-09-15 16:10:01+00","9124187907_10151835907247908",10],[15155,"The Week in Review: \n\nWith the backdrop of Saturday’s fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ crash and the Wall Street-caused recession that followed, surveys showed that Americans continue to overwhelmingly dislike and distrust Wall Street and worry about our economy.

The average hourly pay for a nongovernment, non-supervisory worker, adjusted for price increases, declined to $8.77 last month from $8.85 at the end of the recession in June 2009, Labor Department data show.\n\nStagnant wages erode the spending power of consumers. That means it is harder for them to make purchases ranging from refrigerators to restaurant meals that account for most of the nation's economic growth.\n\nEconomists blame three factors:\n\nEconomic growth remains sluggish, advancing at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of less than 2% for three straight quarters—below the prerecession average of 3.5%. That effectively has put a lid on inflation, which has been near or below the 2% level the Federal Reserve considers healthy for the economy. With demand for labor low, prices not rising fast and 11.5 million unemployed searching for work, employers aren't under pressure to raise wages to retain or attract workers.\n\nBusinesses are changing how they manage payrolls. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a recent paper said that, in the past, companies cut wages when the economy struggled and raised them amid expansions. But in the past three recessions since 1986—and especially the 2007-2009 downturn—companies minimized wage cuts and instead let workers go to keep remaining workers happy. As a result, to compensate for the wage cuts that never were made, businesses now may be capping wage growth. \"As the economy recovers, pent-up wage cuts will probably continue to slow wage growth long after the unemployment rate has returned to more normal levels,\" the researchers said.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=67330205-4852-4ca1-914f-cfbef87ffc13","2013-08-26 18:07:27+00","9124187907_10151790247542908",10],[15212,"Vermont's Next Generation of Hunters: http://youtu.be/RcLCIrKeHmg","2013-08-25 17:10:00+00","9124187907_10151783288672908",10],[15214,"I Have a Dream: http://youtu.be/4Tr8DEQl034","2013-08-24 19:41:24+00","9124187907_10151785799987908",10],[15157,"Today's news from Sen.

That is the economic reality,” Sanders said. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=c1a96894-6d85-4145-91ba-d29037d889c1","2013-09-07 12:53:25+00","9124187907_10151816773542908",10],[15306,"Must Read: Richest 300 Persons on Earth Have More Money Than Poorest 3 Billion - Mark Karlin, Truthout: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=a10e50a7-5b9d-4933-9bb8-decd3ce624dd","2013-07-20 15:26:54+00","9124187907_10151712250367908",10],[15158,"The American People Have Spoken: No More War Abroad, More Jobs at Home - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Huffington Post: \n\nAt a time of great political division in our country President Obama has found a remarkable way to unite Americans of all political persuasions -- conservatives, progressives and moderates.  With a loud and clear voice the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria’s bloody and complicated civil war.\n\n            There are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.’s military intervention in Syria.  \n\n            First, of course, is the much discussed “war weariness.”  The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years, and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years.  The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6,700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care.  Further, as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.  \n\n            But there’s another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years.  And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.  \n\n            Here’s the truth.  The middle class in this country is collapsing. The number of Americans living in poverty is nearly the highest on record and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider.  And very few people in Washington give a damn.  \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/the-american-people-have_b_3916584.html?utm_hp_ref=yahoo\u0026ir=Yahoo","2013-09-13 01:20:00+00","9124187907_10151830843527908",10],[15160,"Today's news from Sen.

This is a good step forward,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy both support diplomatic proposals to remove chemical weapons from Syria, WCAX-TV reported.\n\nObama Must Not Surrender to Class Warfare: President Barack Obama now must turn his focus from Syria to championing progressive solutions to the nation's pressing domestic issues. “The president has got to say, ‘I stand with the working families of the United States, and if the billionaires hate me, so be it.’ He's got to draw the line in the sand... on the class warfare going on in America.” Sen.

But, in overwhelming numbers, Vermonters are telling me they want those issues addressed diplomatically by the UN and the international community — not by unilateral military action on the part of the U.S.,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. \n\nSanders: Focus on Middle Class: Sen. Sanders said Vermonters and the American people want Obama and Congress to focus on more pressing matters hitting closer to home such as the middle class and high unemployment, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. “The American people are saying very loudly and clearly that this country faces enormous crises, economically, global warming, health care, education income and wealth inequality and they want us to start addressing those needs,” Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio. “There is a reason why the vast majority of Americans disapprove of the work that Congress is doing. Vermonters and the American people want President Obama and Congress to focus on the major crises facing the collapsing middle class — high unemployment, low wages, growing wealth and income inequality, the high cost of college, global warming and many other issues,” Sanders said in the Free Press. \n\nObama Failed to Win Senate Support for Syria Strikes: Only about one in 10 members of Congress are currently supporting strikes in Syria, CBS News estimated. The network tally said Sen. Sanders was one of six senators leaning against supporting military intervention, reflecting overwhelming public opposition. “Every once in a while democracy actually works, not very often around here, but the Congress is hearing their message. The president didn't have the votes,” Sen. Sanders told U.S. News \u0026 World Report. \n\nSeize the Opportunity: Sen. Sanders told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux earlier on Tuesday that he hoped the president \"seizes the opportunity\" for international efforts to rid Syria of chemical weapons \"without the United States getting unilaterally involved\" in Syria's civil war. “We’re moving in the right direction and I applaud the American people for making it very clear that they understand that getting involved in a Syrian civil war could have huge implications. The American people are saying to the Congress, ‘Why don’t you pay attention to our needs?’” Sanders told Bloomberg News.

Bernie Sanders told PBS’ Tavis Smiley on Monday. “Russia is jumping in in a constructive way … If they can force Syria for the first time … to acknowledge that they have chemical weapons … and to allow the international community to secure those chemical weapons, then that would be a huge step forward.” \n\nSanders Hopes for Peaceful Resolution: Sen. Sanders voiced a cautious optimism late Monday that the United States might yet find a peaceful resolution to its standoff with Syria. “Most Americans would support an effort that could remove chemical weapons from Syria without American military involvement in another Middle East war,\" he said, according to Seven Days. \"I urge the president and Russia to work vigorously to achieve that goal.\" \n\nSenate Vote Delayed: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Monday that he would not force an initial vote this week on a resolution authorizing military force against Syria. Sen. Sanders welcomed the delay to pursue a diplomatic solution. “As somebody who is not enthusiastic about getting into a war for all kinds of reasons, I think it would been seen by the entire global community as a wonderful victory if you can get chemical weapons out of Syria without the United States getting involved in a bloody war,” Sanders said on PBS.\n\nSenate Opposition to Military Action Increasing: The decision to put off a Senate vote came as opposition to a U.S. strike on Syria was growing even among Obama’s allies and former Senate colleagues. On Monday, six senators — five Republicans and Democrat Heidi Heitkamp — came out against the Syria resolution. Sen. Sanders told Politico that 95 percent of his constituents oppose military strikes against Syria “and that certainly has some influence on me.” \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=67BB7B2F-7FBB-40A1-B627-5E3364A975B5","2013-09-10 13:07:50+00","9124187907_10151825440512908",10],[15170,"As Congress Debates Syria, U.S. Labor Force Hits 35-Year Low:\n\nA key concern of Sen.

The size of the workforce declined by about 300,000 and the participation rate fell to 63.2 percent from 63.4 percent—the lowest since August 1978, according to an analysis by Peter Coy for Bloomberg Businessweek.

He was apprehensive that some on Congress want a broader war aimed at regime change. He had misgivings about taking action without the UN or NATO.

Sanders Airs Concerns on Syria:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this afternoon reiterated his concerns about U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war. \nIn an interview on MSNBC, Sanders made three points.\nFirst, he said that more than 9 out of 10 calls and emails to his office in the past week were against unilateral U.S. action against Syria. “The calls that are coming into my office are overwhelmingly against getting involved in a bloody and complicated civil war in Syria,” Sanders told anchor Alex Witt.\n\nSecond, at a time when the U.S. faces major domestic crises in terms of high unemployment, low wages, massive income and wealth inequality and the planetary threat of global warming, he feared very much that U.S. involvement in Syria would make it even harder for the U.S. government to address the enormous problems facing the American middle class. “The American people are profoundly disgusted with the fact that the United States Congress continues to ignore the enormously serious problems facing the middle class of this country,” Sanders said.\n\nThird, the senator worried that the “surgical strike” against Syria advocated by President Barack Obama could turn into a much deeper engagement and a push for “regime change.” He noted that a resolution passed last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee contained language that could become a basis for broader U.S. involvement. If that occurred, the U.S. involvement could take years, cost billions of dollars and possibly involve U.S. troops. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=c4d5e9a2-c0aa-4026-abf3-c86cf680f868","2013-09-08 22:10:00+00","9124187907_10151820074207908",10],[15175,"Coming up at 1pmET: Sen.

That bothers me a lot,” Sanders told Ed Schultz. \n\nLeaning 'No':  Vermont's delegation remained undecided, but Sanders is concerned that even limited military action might lead to a larger U.S. involvement in Syria's bloody civil war, Vermont Public Radio reported. “I worry very much that with this rush into war, the very serious problems facing Vermonters and people all over this country … will be pushed aside,” Sanders told The Vermont Press Bureau. “So there will be less discussion about creating jobs, less discussion about making college affordable, less discussion about protecting … Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.” In Seven Days and Politico, Sanders also was said to be leaning against intervention. \n\nCaregivers for Veterans: The Department of Veterans Affairs said Wednesday it supports expanding a caregivers benefit for seriously wounded veterans if Congress come up with the billions needed to pay for the expansion, The Associated Press reported. Sen. Sanders sponsored a bill to enroll an additional 70,000 caregivers in the program by 2016. Under the legislation, any veteran with a \"serious-service connected disability\" would qualify for caregiver assistance. \n\nU.S. Dismisses U.N. Inspections in Syria: The Obama administration has asserted that the findings by United Nations experts of alleged chemical attacks no longer matter, citing its own evidence that the Syrian government was behind the attack last month in the Damascus suburbs. Few lawmakers have pressed the administration to wait for the inspectors to release their results. Weapons experts say the on-the-ground analysis could confirm key forensic details about the attack, possibly bolster the case against the Syrian government and help rally international support for action, according to The Washington Post. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=BB77912D-A26B-4764-8805-DB886E39C355","2013-09-05 13:38:49+00","9124187907_10151811261452908",10],[15188,"Who Pays for Military Strikes Against Syria?: \n\nWhile saying “there is no debate about the horrors of chemical warfare,”  Sen.

He cited jobs and global warming among priorities that are important to Americans but lost in the debate on Syria. He also asked how a U.S. military intervention would be paid for. “We’ve cut back on education, we’ve cut back on nutrition programs, we’ve thrown kids off Head Start.

In a letter to the director of the federal Bureau of Prisons, the senators said the plan would leave the region without any prison spaces for females, creating unnecessary hardship for inmates' families. \n\nStudent Loans: As a member of the Senate education committee, Sen. Sanders cited Congressional Budget Office projections that interest rates would hit 7.25 percent for undergraduate loans in five years under a bill awaiting President Obama’s approval. By 2018, graduate loans would go up to 8.8 percent and parents would be charged 9.8 percent on loans for their children to attend college, according to the analysis by the non-partisan agency that provides economic data for Congress. “The delegation is correct to give fail marks to this plan,” the Rutland Herald said in an editorial.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E7EF85F0-881B-4BB8-B6B5-6070B0B28B60","2013-08-06 13:31:06+00","9124187907_10151746465237908",10],[15268,"Wal-Mart on Wal-Mart:\n\nA Wal-Mart spokesman on Monday told The Huffington Post that only 5 percent of the discount chain’s workers were on Medicaid.

What the spokesman may have forgotten to mention was that an internal memo to  Wal-Mart’s board of directors (obtained by The New York Times) acknowledged that 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart's 1.33 million U.S. employees were uninsured or on Medicaid. The 2005 memo by M. Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, had more to say about how the company treats its workers:\n\n- Wal-Mart's workers are getting sicker than the national population with preventable diseases such as obesity (p. 4). More than half of Wal-Mart's workers (p. 8) are not covered by its health insurance plans, meaning many do not have access to necessary preventative care and doctors' visits. \"Our workers are getting sicker than the national population, particularly with obesity-related diseases\".\n\n- Wal-Mart's workers aren't using primary care because so many of them lack coverage. Instead, they opt to use taxpayer-subsidized emergency rooms.

For starters, the recovery from the 2008 financial meltdown has been uneven. From 2009 to 2011, the wealthiest 1 percent saw their incomes grow by 11.2 percent, while incomes shrunk by 0.4 percent for the other 99 percent of the country. Second, deficit pressures have been temporarily relieved. “We have cut the deficit in half,” Sen. Sanders told the Fiscal Times. “Put that on the front pages of the paper.

More walkouts are expected at fast-food restaurants in seven cities on Monday. Earlier this month hundreds of low-wage employees working for federal contractors in Washington walked out and picketed along Pennsylvania Avenue to urge President Obama to press their employers to raise wages.\n\nAna Salvador, who earns $10 an hour after 10 years working at the McDonald’s inside the National Air and Space Museum, wrote Mr. Obama to say that she did not earn enough to support her four children, adding that her family relied on food stamps and Medicaid. Another striker, Karla Quezada, who has worked at the Subway inside the Ronald Reagan Building for 11 years, said that while her employer made “lots of money off of my work, I still only make $9.50 an hour.” This is higher than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as the District of Columbia’s $8.25 minimum — many states have minimums above the federal level — but it isn’t much after more than a decade on the job. In a speech in Galesburg, Ill., last Wednesday aimed at bolstering the middle class, Mr. Obama called for raising the minimum wage.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/sunday-review/fighting-back-against-wretched-wages.html?smid=pl-share","2013-07-28 14:26:47+00","9124187907_10151728645027908",10],[15294,"Raise the Minimum Wage: http://youtu.be/OfXYze1Epm0","2013-07-25 15:50:00+00","9124187907_10151723032227908",10],[15308,"The Week in Review: \n\nUnder pressure from the White House, Senate leaders agreed Wednesday on a plan to tie federal student loan interest rates to rising market rates.

If the same CBO projections come true, parents by 2018 would be charged 9.7 percent on college loans.\n\n“At a time when the average student is graduating from a four-year college $27,000 in debt, when hundreds of thousands of capable young people no longer see college as an option because of high costs and when the U.S. is falling further and further behind our economic competitors in terms of the percentage of young people graduating from college, no agreement should be passed which, over a period of years, makes a bad situation worse and will make college even less affordable than it is today,” Sanders said.\n\n“At a time when Democrats control the White House and the U.S. Senate, we should not support bad legislation almost identical to that passed by a very conservative, Republican-led House.

It’s set to get worse on July 1 when, barring a congressional deal, the rate charged on federally subsidized Stafford loans will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), POLITICO: \n\nIf a nation were judged by how well it cares for its weakest and most vulnerable citizens, the United States would not get high marks.\n\nIn America today, while the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, poverty among seniors is increasing and nearly half of all seniors are now unable to afford their basic living expenses, according to a recent study from the Economic Policy Institute. Four million seniors live on less than $11,000 a year, and 8 million seniors face the threat of hunger. Tragically, according to the AARP Foundation, the number of hungry seniors in the U.S. more than doubled from 2001 to 2009. As distressing as these national statistics are, poverty and hunger are even worse for older women, minorities and those living in rural communities.\n\nOne of the most effective programs devised to address the needs of vulnerable seniors is the Older Americans Act. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 along with the better-known Medicare and Medicaid programs. In an extremely cost-effective way, this program is providing high-quality nutrition to more than 1 million frail and isolated older adults through the Meals on Wheels program. It also provides subsidized meals at senior centers throughout the country and employment opportunities for low-income older Americans.\n\nThis is a program that not only works well in easing isolation, hunger and suffering, it also saves taxpayers substantial sums of money. Not surprisingly, seniors who are malnourished are more likely to suffer serious illnesses, to break hips because of a fall or, for a variety of reasons, end up in hospital emergency rooms at great expense. To my mind, it makes a lot more sense to provide adequate nutrition to frail seniors than to spend money on preventable hospital costs. The simple truth is, we can feed a senior for an entire year for the cost of one day in a hospital. Further, a Brown University study determined that providing adequate nutrition reduces the need for nursing home care, which costs $80,000 per year.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/keep-meals-on-wheels-to-deliver-security-to-many-92989.html#ixzz2WgCXM0gj","2013-06-19 16:19:39+00","9124187907_10151648669017908",10],[15385,"VIDEO: NSA Snooping: http://youtu.be/s4jdE3fks1Q","2013-06-18 16:50:46+00","9124187907_10151646939392908",10],[15387,"Sanders, Boxer Propose Climate Change Bills: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2a869a44-1597-42a8-b625-1a88db3febbc","2013-06-21 18:36:54+00","9124187907_10151652766677908",10],[15389,"Happening now: Sen.

He said the study showed the need for legislation to prevent the doubling of interest rates to 6.8 percent next month on some Stafford student loans, The Associated Press reported. In a statement, the senator said \"short term, we need to make certain rates don't go up this summer. Long term, we need to figure out a way to make college more affordable,\" WPTZ-TV reported. \n\nNSA Surveillance: National Security Agency officials testified Tuesday on Capitol Hill about secret domestic surveillance programs. General Keith Alexander, the NSA director, claimed more than 50 attacks were stopped using the controversial surveillance programs. Sweeping up the telephone records of every innocent American goes too far, Sen. Sanders told MSNBC. \"If they believe somebody is involved in terrorist activity, we want them to be able to go after that guy in any way they can, but you can't have a blanket system in which every single phone call in America is in the government file.\" On NBC Radio News, Sanders asked, “Are we comfortable with the government having that much information. I think most Americans are not.” \n\nVA Claims Backlog: The VA announced that the amount of time veterans must wait to receive benefits is decreasing, but members of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs – especially Chairman Sanders and Sen.

Sanders on Monday introduced an amendment to ensure that American corporations cannot exploit foreign exchange students as cheap laborers to replace young American workers. National Review said Sanders has opposed \"corporate welfare\" provisions in the bill and proposed funding youth jobs programs to curb the economic desire for cheap foreign workers. \n\nNSA Snooping: Vermont's congressional delegation is seeking greater transparency and heightened safeguards for the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs, the Burlington Free Press reported. Sen. Sanders introduced legislation to curb the federal government's powers to secretly track data on millions of Americans without first proving reasonable suspicion. “The issue is not complicated. I think everybody understands that we've got to do everything we can to protect the American people from international terrorism, which is a real threat. On the other hand, you can do that without collecting the phone records of hundreds of millions of Americans,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News. \n\nFighting for Workers: The “spokesperson for the working folk of America,” is how syndicated radio host Ed Schultz described Sen. Sanders in an interview that aired on Monday about the career of the longest serving independent in the history of Congress. “To be frank with you, Ed, it never occurred to me in a million years that I would be elected to the Senate.”\n\nDairy Farms: The Dairy Security Act, which would empower a dairy farmer to respond to market signals when determining how much milk to produce, holds the key to the future of family-owned dairy farms in Vermont and across the country. “I am fighting side by side with Vermont’s dairy farmers, along with Sens. Leahy and Sanders, to pass this bill. It’s an uphill battle, but it’s a fight well worth having,” Rep.

During an interview Saturday on The Ed Show on MSNBC, Sanders also called for a building program to create jobs repairing America’s crumbling roads and bridges and transforming our energy systems. “Let’s be clear. Most of the families that receive food stamps have kids. Most working people would rather have a paycheck than be on food stamps,” Sanders said. \n\nNSA Claims it Stopped 20 Plots: Top U.S. intelligence officials said Saturday that information gleaned from two controversial data-collection programs run by the National Security Agency thwarted potential terrorist plots in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries — and that gathered data is destroyed every five years. Last year, fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of U.S. phone records gathered daily by the NSA. No other new details about the plots or the countries involved were part of the newly declassified information released on Saturday and made public by the Senate Intelligence Committee, The Associated Press reported. \n\nSenators Challenge NSA Claims: Before Saturday’s release of declassified documents, two prominent Senate critics of the NSA's dragnet surveillance challenged the agency's assertion that the spy efforts helped stop \"dozens\" of terror attacks. Mark Udall and Ron Wyden, both members of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were not convinced by the testimony of the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, who claimed that evidence gleaned from surveillance helped thwart attacks in the US. \"We have not yet seen any evidence showing that the NSA's dragnet collection of Americans' phone records has produced any uniquely valuable intelligence,\" they said in a statement released on Thursday ahead of a widely anticipated briefing for US senators about the National Security Agency's activities, The Guardian reported. \n\nNSA Spying Resurrected: In 2004, acting attorney general James B. Comey and the Justice Department’s top leadership reached the brink of resignation over electronic surveillance orders that they believed to be illegal. President George W. Bush backed down, halting secret foreign-intelligence-gathering operations that had crossed into domestic terrain. That morning marked the beginning of the end of four surveillance programs that brought Americans and American territory within the domain of the National Security Agency for the first time in decades. It was also a prelude to new legal structures that allowed Bush and then President Obama to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach, according to The Washington Post.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=edf7e2b9-a070-4085-96f4-0edc203aecbd","2013-06-16 11:54:16+00","9124187907_10151642233162908",10],[15406,"Immigration Reform: \n\nThe Senate on Tuesday voted to advance an immigration reform bill.

Sanders said on The Thom Hartmann Program Friday.\n\nDomestic Surveillance: Vermont's congressional delegation remains concerned about the widespread spying programs. \"As one of the few members of Congress who consistently voted against the Patriot Act, I expressed concern at the time of passage that it gave the government far too much power to spy on innocent United State citizens and provided for very little oversight or disclosure. Unfortunately, what I said turned out to be exactly true,” Sen. Sanders was quoted in the Valley News.\n\nNSA Briefings: Senators received classified briefings from National Security Agency officials this week after revelations shed light on two secret surveillance programs, reported. Some senators emerged from the briefing with positive comments about the administration's new transparency efforts on Capitol Hill. Critics of the surveillance programs remain concerned. “They have not done a particularly good job in explaining it to the American people,” Sen. Sanders told Politico.\n\nImmigration Reform: With the Senate expected to vote on a far-reaching immigration bill by early July, supporters are stepping up their courtship of the many lawmakers who remain publicly undecided. Efforts to address the concerns of the holdouts will shape the next two weeks of action in the Senate. Sen.

Tammy Baldwin, consider themselves to be consumer advocates and backers of the public's right to know, John Nichols wrote for The (Madison, Wis.) Capital Times. The other 43 \"no\" votes came from Republicans, like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, almost all of whom say they want to free up the states to experiment and innovate.\n\nToo Big to Fail: Sen. Sanders and Rep. Brad Sherman have introduced legislation that would give the Treasury Department 90 days to identify commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and insurance companies whose “failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy.” Treasury would then be required to break up those institutions, according to In These Times. “No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis. … If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,” Sanders said.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=346FEE4D-4A58-4E07-B16F-9FB23F9F3BF2","2013-06-06 13:22:53+00","9124187907_10151623881812908",10],[15425,"Immigration Reform:\n\nSen.

After all, if we take at face value the claims made back in 2008 by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse.\n\nBut now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.\n\nMost people are now familiar with President's Obama's proposal to cut Social Security by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). While the final formula is somewhat convoluted, the net effect is to reduce benefits by an average of roughly 3.0 percent.\n\nSince Social Security benefits account for more than 70 percent of the income of a typical retiree, this cut is more than a 2.0 percent reduction in income. By comparison, a wealthy couple earning $500,000 a year would see a hit to their after-tax income of just 0.6 percent from the tax increase that President Obama put in place last year...\n\nClick here to continue reading: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/-cutting-social-security_b_3281777.html","2013-05-16 15:12:33+00","9124187907_10151587624662908",10],[15508,"Join Sen.

That may soon change.\n\nIn last year’s “fiscal cliff” debate, President Obama offered to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security benefits, a spending cut favored by Republicans and scorned by Democrats. Republicans rejected the offer because Mr. Obama wanted tax increases in exchange, while Democrats said it would be too harmful.

The House Republican budget also steered clear of explicit cuts to Social Security, a move partly aimed at isolating Mr. Obama.\n\nThe question now is whether Mr. Obama will again propose to cut the COLA when he unveils his budget next week. We think he should not do so. The president might want to seem like he is willing to compromise by renewing his call for a COLA cut.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nThe media appear fixated about when and if a so-called “grand bargain” on our economy will be reached. Wrong question! The question we should be asking is: What should be in a “grand bargain” that works for the average American?\n\nAt a time when the middle class is disappearing, 46 million Americans are living in poverty and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, we need a “grand bargain” that protects struggling working families, not billionaires.\n\nWith corporate profits at record-breaking levels while the effective corporate tax is at its lowest level since 1972, and 1 out of 4 profitable corporations pays nothing in federal income taxes, we need a grand bargain that ends corporate loopholes and demands that corporate America starts helping us with deficit reduction. We must not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must not cut Social Security, disabled veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs that provide opportunity and dignity to millions of struggling American families.\n\nBefore we pass a grand bargain, we have got to take a hard and sober look at what’s happening economically in our country today. In doing so, we must acknowledge that the United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth and that inequality is worse today than at any time since the late 1920s. Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America — 150 million Americans. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. Incredibly, the Federal Reserve reported last year that median net worth for middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007-2010. That’s the equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average middle-class family. \n\nThe distribution of income is even worse. If you can believe it, the last study on the subject showed that all of the new income gained from 2009-2011 went to the top 1 percent. ALL of the new income!\n\nContinue reading here: http://thehill.com/special-reports/government-finances-march-2013/288859-grand-bargain-could-be-grand-sellout","2013-03-19 17:30:39+00","9124187907_434668173274521",10],[15655,"End Offshore Tax Havens:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that its own analysis of 60 big U.S. companies found that they parked $166 billion offshore last year.

Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has called for closing those tax loopholes to help bring down deficits. “At a time when we have a $16.6 trillion national debt; at a time when roughly one-quarter of the largest corporations in America are paying no federal income taxes; and at a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high, it is past time for corporate America to contribute significantly to deficit reduction,” he said.\n\nDo you believe Congress should or should not close loopholes allowing corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid U.S. taxes by shifting income overseas?\n\nTake the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=15714608-4BB8-4C8B-82A4-607926872B05","2013-03-11 21:20:25+00","9124187907_147684592063626",10],[15657,"Join Sen.

Republicans in Congress, Sanders added, “are absolutely adamant that they will not ask the wealthy and large corporations to pay a nickel more in taxes and the only way they want to do deficit reduction is by cutting, cutting, cutting.”\n\nKeystone Pipeline: The State Department issued a revised environmental impact statement for the 1,700-mile pipeline on Friday that makes no recommendation about whether the project should be built but presents no conclusive environmental reason it should not be, The New York Times reported. \n\nNational Guard: Uncertainty about how sequestration cuts could affect the Vermont National Guard hung over the swearing-in Friday of Maj. Gen. Steven Cray as adjutant general. “You are assuming office on a very unusual day,” Sen. Sanders told Cray. “You face not a military conflict but a financial conflict.” Sanders vowed to do all he could to lessen the blow to the Guard, the Burlington Free Press reported.\n\nBudget Political Ploy: The Senate this week defeated a Republican proposal to let the president decide what programs to cut. On Vermont Public Television’s “Vermont This Week,”, Sen. Sanders called it a “political ploy that would say, ‘Okay Mr. President, we’re going to give you the flexibility, we’re going to let you decide whether you’re cutting back on the National Guard, whether you’re cutting back on nutrition, whether you’re cutting back on Head Start, whether you’re cutting back on education so the people are not going to blame us. They’re going to blame you.’ It was really a very superficial political ploy.” \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=52178189-d483-45a0-9f88-36779c3071ba","2013-03-02 13:01:20+00","9124187907_608716175821589",10],[15685,"Sanders: Don’t Cut Social Security and Disabled Veterans’ Benefits: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=b0d41991-0b0b-4d64-b312-874e144555eb","2013-03-01 18:29:52+00","9124187907_10151452098962908",10],[15686,"Today's news from Sen.

A White House meeting with congressional leaders on Friday was unlikely to come up with an alternative to chopping $85 billion in federal spending by Sept. 30. The sequester, as the cuts are called, was set in motion by a 2011 budget deal that Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against. Interviewed Thursday night on Vermont Public Television, Sanders said the cuts will “contract the economy in the midst of a terrible recession” and may eliminate 700,000 jobs nationwide.\n\nWall Street Tax: Democrats in the House and Senate, seizing on concerns over budget deficits, are renewing their push for a tax on financial transactions. Sen. Sanders cosponsored a bill introduced Thursday by Sen. Tom Harkin, CQ-Roll Call reported. The legislation is expected to run into opposition from the financial industry and the Obama administration.\n\nViolence Against Women: The Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization was approved by the House on Thursday by a vote of 286 to 136, The New York Times reported. A total of 87 Republicans voted in favor of the Senate bill after several Republicans broke with their leadership to defeat a weaker House version. \n\nGay Marriage: The Obama administration told the Supreme Court on Thursday that California’s ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection, a position that could also cast doubt on prohibitions in other states. The administration did not endorse a constitutional right to marry that would apply nationwide, The Washington Post reported.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=33087182-62D2-4507-9F5D-DA6DB0783FAA","2013-03-01 14:08:16+00","9124187907_480744041992664",10],[15689,"Today's news from Sen.

Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped the effort succeeds. “There is nobody who believes sequestration makes a lot of sense,” Sanders told Chris Jansing on MSNBC. \n\nUndoing the New Deal: Some in Congress see a rare opportunity to whittle down Pentagon spending but say the military cuts are not enough to justify damage to other programs. ''While the Democrats may be winning the political battle, Republicans are winning the ideological war,'' Sen. Sanders told The New York Times. ''The goal of the right wing is to essentially undo the Roosevelt era, the New Deal, substantially cut back on government, and in a sense, they are achieving that. This is a huge step.'' \n\nSanders Voted No on Sequester: With its meat-cleaver hacks, the sequester was intentionally designed to force compromise.  In the Senate, six Democrats plus Sanders voted no when the sequester mechanism was put in place in 2011. House Democrats split down the middle on the deal 95-95, with most progressives voting against it, according to Salon. \n\nBankers Dodge Taxes: In a statement on the Senate floor explaining why he would vote against Lew, Sen. Sanders accused Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs of taking taxpayer bailouts and then avoiding U.S. taxes, The Huffington Post reported. “When it comes to paying their taxes, oh, suddenly they love the Cayman Islands,” Sanders said of Wall Street banks. “So my suggestion is, the next time these crooks destroy their banks and they need to be bailed out, let them go to the government of the Cayman Islands to get their bailout.” \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=362DAAD3-F4C7-40E1-88E7-6BD8E23C55F8","2013-02-28 14:12:50+00","9124187907_131280407050485",10],[15690,"Join Sen.

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called $85 billion in across-the-board spending reductions due to take effect starting Friday “a dumb way to do cuts.” On The Ed Schultz Show, Sanders said more revenue is needed to lower deficits. He noted that total revenue today amounts to about 16 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. That’s down from more than 20 percent the last time the federal budget was balanced when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nCarbon Tax: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday hit back at a National Association of Manufacturers report claiming that a tax on carbon emissions to fight global warming would cut factory output and hurt the U.S. economy. The cost of not responding to climate change would escalate costs to taxpayers, homeowners and businesses as natural disasters become more frequent, Sanders countered. Legislation that Sanders introduced with Sen. Barbara Boxer calls for a $75 billion in the coming decade to help manufacturers invest in energy efficiency and make them more competitive. It also would invest $10 billion over 10 years for job-training programs for workers in new energy technologies, Reuters reported. \n\nVA Backlog: Sen. Sanders told an American Legion conference in Washington on Tuesday that an “overwhelmed, broken claims system” at the Department of Veterans Affairs is not prepared for the arrival of new veterans as combat troops return home from Afghanistan, Stars and Stripes reported.

Just two years later, at a time of mounting deficits largely created by the recession that Wall Street caused, the major financial institutions did everything they could to avoid paying American taxes by establishing shell corporations in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by the Rutland Herald. \n\nTax Havens: One out of four profitable corporations pays nothing in taxes. Government revenue as a percentage of GDP is lower than at any time in history. Sen. Sanders and Jan Schakowsky have an answer. They introduced a bill that would raise $590 billion over the next decade and stop giving tax breaks to corporations for shipping jobs overseas, according to the San Diego Free Press. \n\nChinese to Tax Carbon Emissions: China’s Ministry of Finance announced that the country will levy a tax on carbon emissions, the Xinhua news service reported. Policy experts in the United States and Europe have long argued that a carbon tax is the most effective way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, but implementing one in most large industrialized countries has always seemed politically infeasible. In the U.S., Sens. Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders have proposed a carbon tax of $20 a ton, the digital economics news service Quartz noted. \n\nCampaign Funding: The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a challenge to federal campaign contribution limits to political candidates. “The laborious route of a constitutional amendment stating plainly that corporations are not people and that money is not speech is really the only avenue left in reforming what the Court has done … The simplest one with the straightest line would seem to be the one that Bernie Sanders has been pushing,” Charles Pierce blogged for Esquire.  \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=6F0293C5-6782-4064-88F0-192B6DEEC130","2013-02-21 14:57:47+00","9124187907_349358365180074",10],[15704,"Environmental Scorecard:\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters on Wednesday released its 2012 National Environmental Scorecard.

The Vermont values of universal freedom and equality were carried to the highest office in the country by two American presidents who called Vermont their birth-state.\n\nChester Alan Arthur was the 21st president of the United States, born in North Fairfield, Vt. on October 5, 1829. He was the son of a Vermont native, Malvina Stone and  William Arthur, an abolitionist Baptist preacher who immigrated to North America from Ireland. Arthur was a colonel in the American Civil War, in charge of outfitting and housing troops in New York. He was  elected vice president on the Republican ticket of 1880 and assumed the presidency after the assassination of President James A. Garfield. President Arthur continued his father’s quest to restore equality for all Americans after the end of Reconstruction, defending the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and increasing education funding for Native Americans.\n\nCalvin Coolidge, the 30th president famously known as “Silent Cal,” was born in Plymouth, Vt. on Independence Day in 1872. Like Arthur, President Coolidge assumed the office after serving as Vice President when President Warren G. Harding passed away in 1923. President Coolidge received the news while visiting Vermont and signed the oath of office by light of a kerosene lamp, administered by his father, John Sr., who was a notary. Coolidge also fought for civil rights in a post-war era, reducing the influence of the Ku Klux Klan by keeping them from appointed office. He also signed the Indian Citizenship Act granting full U.S. citizenship to Native Americans while allowing them to retain their land and cultural rights.\n\nVermont can list Arthur and Coolidge with pride among its many citizens who have made a positive difference in American history. Both men are bound together by the unforeseen circumstances that bestowed the presidency upon them and by the actions that helped advance the tradition of equality and civil rights that Vermont still fights for today.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1A1C346F-F1FB-42CE-B6FC-2AD84B0E7A9D","2013-02-18 17:30:01+00","9124187907_425495530866778",10],[15712,"This week Sen.

Peter Welch all found common ground with the president, coming out in support of at least parts of his plan, according to the Burlington Free Press. “Congress must consider a comprehensive approach which includes a serious discussion about guns, the need for greatly expanded mental health services and ending gratuitous violence in the media. I intend to play an active role in that debate,” Sanders said. \n\nMedia Monopolies: Speculation about Fisher Communications being put up for sale raises the disturbing prospect of losing the last local owner of commercial broadcast television in Seattle. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Sanders confronted the Federal Communications Commission over its stealth plans to relax long-standing rules about cross-ownership of broadcast outlets and newspapers, according to a Seattle Times editorial. “We cannot live in a vibrant democracy unless people get divergent sources of information and have the opportunity to have serious debate about the major issues of the day,” Sanders said. \n\nIndependent Voice: Sen. Sanders was praised in a letter to the editor to The (Ronan, Mont.) Valley Journal. Bob McClellan praised Sanders’ stance on resisting austerity in deficit talks and opposing Jack Lew’s nomination for Treasury Secretary. “He cuts through all the political posturing, the evading of problems’ root causes, and the bobbing and weaving of so many politicians,” McClellan said. “He seems to speak for the vast majority of Americans.” \n\nProfessor Gutman: A former English professor is returning to UVM in the fall after serving as a chief of staff to Sen.

The move shocked Congressional Democrats and dismayed Mr. Obama’s liberal base.\n\nThe offer, however, was rejected by House Republicans who could not stomach the tax increases and other concessions that Mr. Obama demanded as part of the deal. The talks moved on, and when all was said and done, Republicans did not get the lower cost-of-living adjustments (known as COLAs) and Mr. Obama did not get the concessions he had sought.\n\nBut that is not the end of the story. As the next round of deficit reduction talks gets under way, the administration seems determined to include the COLA cut in any new package of spending reductions. Rather than using the issue as a bargaining ploy, the administration appears to have embraced it as a worthy end in itself.\n\nIs it? In a word, no.\n\nThat is not to say that Social Security should be off the table. There are reforms that are eminently sensible, if only the political will could be found to enact them. But reducing the COLA is not a sound idea now and may never be.\n\nAt issue is the way inflation is calculated. The administration’s offer in the fiscal cliff talks — and the approach long advocated by Republicans — calls for using a new measure of inflation, called the “chained” Consumer Price Index, to calculate the COLA.\n\nUnlike the gauge of inflation currently in use, the chained index captures the ability of consumers to adjust their spending across categories as relative prices change — for instance, spending less on fuel as gas prices go up and more on groceries as food prices go down. Such substitution causes the chained C.P.I. to rise more slowly than the current measure, which would result in a lower annual COLA and huge budget savings. The move to a chained C.P.I. would reduce benefits by some $135 billion over 10 years, and far more in later decades because of compounding.\n\nThe administration and other proponents of switching to a chained C.P.I. contend that it is a technical fix in the interest of greater accuracy, not a benefit cut per se.\n\nBut that claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The chained index is in many ways a better method of tracking price changes for the broad working population, but there is no compelling evidence that it is better for computing the Social Security COLA.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/misguided-social-security-reform.html","2013-01-14 23:25:15+00","9124187907_126073060893793",10],[15806,"Sanders: End Conflicts of Interest at the Fed: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=727b3e52-92e7-4490-89bf-17ca6f2dcb76","2013-01-14 18:01:56+00","9124187907_10151339538167908",10],[15807,"Today's news from Sen.

Bernie Sanders was disappointed that President Obama wasn't more aggressive during the budget negotiations in standing up to what he calls a \"right-wing, extremist Republican Party.\" His advice to the president for his second term is to stand firm on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as to push for corporations to start paying their fair share in taxes. \"If the president stands firm ... he will have the overwhelming majority of Americans behind him,\" Sanders told National Public Radio. \n\nSocial Security: \"We've got to make the president and Republicans and any Democrats that want to cut Social Security an offer they can`t refuse, and that is tens of millions of people have got to make it very clear to Congress -- Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit,\" Sanders said Friday night in an interview with MSNBC's Ed Schultz, The Hill blogged. \n\nProgressives: “What being a progressive is about right now is standing up and fighting for working families,” Sen. Sanders told NPR. Is Obama a progressive? “No,” Sanders said. “[H]e is kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party but no I don’t think he is a progressive. \n\nTax Breaks for the Rich: In a column published Sunday by the Burlington Free Press, Sanders criticized tax breaks for the wealthy included in the year-end budget agreement. He cited an inheritance tax break for the richest 0.3 percent of Americans and the extension of Bush-era tax cuts on income, capital gains and dividends for households making between $250,000 and $450,000 a year. “The wealthiest Americans, whose effective tax rates are very low, are going to have to take much more responsibility for deficit reduction than this agreement provides.” \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9d20a78d-2cb5-43ee-acde-c7e84135da9f","2013-01-06 14:33:15+00","9124187907_431930890212439",10],[15833,"Coming up at 7pmET: Sen.

Today, that same 90 percent is controlled by six companies: GE, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. “In short, it amounts to a monopoly on what we hear, and what we view, on TV and radio,” Jim Martin wrote in a Denver Post column critical of a Federal Communications Commission proposal to relax rules on media ownership. \n\nFiscal Cliff Bill Falls Short: The so-called fiscal cliff legislation signed into law by President Obama is not a good bill.

As a grandfather of seven children, the senator added that “our thoughts and prayers are with the families.”\n\nGun Debate: In an emotional statement on the school shootings, President Obama signaled that a long-dormant debate on guns in America may be re-engaged, The New York Times reported. “We have been through this too many times. We’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,” Obama said. He mentioned a recent attack in an Oregon shopping mall and shootings last July in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. WCAX-TV reported that Sen. Sanders issued a statement saying that “as a nation, we must do all that we can to figure out how tragedies like this do not continue to occur.” Sen. Chuck Schumer echoed Sanders’ sentiment. “Perhaps an awful tragedy like this will bring us together so we can do what it takes to prevent this horror from being repeated again.\" \n\nDeficit Talks: Republicans have proposed making the formula used for cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security and other programs less generous. It's something known as a chained CPI, referring to the consumer price index. Sen. Sanders earlier this week rallied opponents of such reforms, National Public Radio reported Saturday. \"People are very clear about what they want, and then you got folks here inside the Beltway who get huge amounts of campaign contributions from the wealthy and large corporations. They have a different perspective,\" he said, \"but we have the people on our side.\" \n\nVeterans’ Committee: As he takes over the chairmanship of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sen. Sanders says his immediate concerns are to fight a proposal that would reduce benefits for veterans and their families and to expedite disability claims. The appointment marks his first full committee chairmanship since first being elected to that chamber in 2006, the Times Argus reported online. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=97a7065b-4b46-48b9-a9e4-70f610972e81","2012-12-15 12:55:21+00","9124187907_383365771749459",10],[15893,"The Week in Review:\n\nFlags on Capitol Hill, across Vermont and throughout America were lowered to half-staff on Friday after a mass murder at a Connecticut grade school.

On Wednesday, when Sanders was tapped to chair the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, he said his first order of business would be to block a House Republican proposal to slash benefits for disabled veterans.

Sanders cited a poll Tuesday in The Washington Post that found that Americans overwhelmingly say do not cut Social Security, do not cut Medicare, do not cut Medicaid.

This is what Democrats – and most Republicans – said during the recently finished campaign that they would never do.

The last thing you want to do is cut Social Security benefits,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz on Tuesday.  He cited a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed a clear majority of Americans, 74 percent, would go along with Obama’s initial proposal to raise taxes on those with incomes over $250,000. The same poll found 60 percent of Americans said it is unacceptable to change the way Social Security benefits are calculated so that benefits increase with inflation at a slower rate than they do now.

Obama senior adviser David Plouffe said the deal will blend tax reform and entitlement reform. Sen. Sanders said Plouffe’s remark “concerns me deeply.” Americans do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits, Sanders said, and overwhelming majorities favor making the wealthiest people and the largest corporations help tame the deficit. Citing the latest poll, Schultz concluded that “the public agrees with Sen. Sanders.” \n\nNo New Year’s Cataclysm: If some Democrats had their way, the country wouldn’t be facing the “fiscal cliff” but a “fiscal slope,” “fiscal curve” or even an “austerity crisis.” If there’s no deal by Dec. 31, Obama still has authority to stall in implementing the big tax and spending changes. “This is not like the debt ceiling debate where in fact, if you don’t pay your bills on a certain date, there are very dramatic repercussions,” Sen. Sanders told Politico. “The truth of the matter is we could go into the next year, and if we can reach an agreement in the new Congress, in the first weeks or months or two, I don’t think a whole lot of people will know the difference. So it’s not like something cataclysmic happens on Dec. 31.” \n\nSocial Security: A 2 percent payroll tax cut trumpeted by lawmakers as a way to lift the sagging economy will expire on Dec. 31. Policymakers don't seem too upset. Sen. Sanders, a vocal advocate of social insurance programs, on Monday told The Huffington Post that he is “strongly opposed” to extending the tax holiday since doing so could damage Social Security's solvency. “The middle class deserves tax relief, but not at the expense of Social Security,” Sanders said. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4FBDD1E3-1995-4118-83A0-B64895A52B1E","2012-11-27 14:17:46+00","9124187907_106166466216877",10],[15948,"Happening now: Sen.

The American people have been very clear,” Sanders said. \n\nNo Deal Over a Bad Deal: Sen. Sanders talked with MSNBC host Ed Schultz about the ongoing budget negotiations saying, “We saw this movie in 2010 and 2011 and what people don't understand is that despite the growing income, the wealthiest people did not pay a nickel more in taxes and yet we cut $900 billion in programs that the middle class and working families of our country desperately need.”  \n\nShared Sacrifice: In an early edition of the weekly radio show ‘Brunch with Bernie’, Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThe Democrats won a major victory on Election Day.\n\nDespite dozens of billionaires spending huge amounts of money to defeat President Barack Obama, he won a crushing victory in the Electoral College and received 3 million more votes than former Gov. Mitt Romney did nationally. Democrats won 25 of 33 seats contested in the Senate and, to everyone’s surprise, expanded their majority there by two. They also gained seats in the House.\n\nNow, with this victory behind them, the president and congressional Democrats must make it very clear that they will stand with the middle class and working families of our country. These are the people who, because of the Wall Street-caused recession, have seen a significant decline in their family income. These are the people who worry about whether they can afford health care and whether their kids will be able to attend college. The Democrats in the House and Senate must stand with these people — not the millionaires and billionaires who are doing just fine.\n\nMost important, in the coming weeks and months, the Democrats must demand that deficit reduction is done in a way that is fair — and not on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. At a time when real unemployment remains close to 15 percent, we must also focus on creating the millions of jobs that our people need.\nIn America today, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth. Incredibly, the top 1 percent owns 42 percent of the nation’s wealth while the bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. In the last study done on income distribution, we learned that 93 percent of all new income generated between 2009 and 2010 went to the top 1 percent while the bottom 99 percent split the remaining 7 percent. This extraordinary unfairness is not only morally reprehensible, it is bad economics. It will be very difficult to create the jobs that our people need when so many Americans have little or no money to spend.\n\nCongress must pass legislation to create a major jobs program to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. Throughout our country, we need a massive effort to improve our roads, bridges, water and wastewater systems, airports, rail, broadband and cellphone service. Rebuilding our infrastructure makes us more productive and internationally competitive — and creates millions of new jobs.\n\nIn terms of deficit reduction, let us not forget that in 2001, when Bill Clinton left office, this country had a $236 billion surplus. As a result of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were unpaid for, huge tax breaks for the rich, a Medicare prescription drug program put on the credit card and a significant decline in federal revenues because of the recession, we now have a $1 trillion deficit and a $16 trillion national debt.\n\nCongress must address the deficit situation and the fiscal cliff, but we must do it in a way that is fair. At a time when the wealthiest people in this country are doing extremely well and their effective tax rates are low (think Romney), the people on top must pay their fair share of taxes to help us deal with the deficit. We must also end the outrageous loopholes that allow one out of four large profitable corporations to pay nothing in federal corporate income taxes. Further, it is absurd that current tax policy allows the wealthy and large corporations to avoid paying over $100 billion a year in federal taxes because they stash their money in tax havens in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere.\n\nWe must also take a hard look at wasteful spending in the Defense Department, where we now spend almost as much money as the rest of the world combined. Significant savings can be found at other federal agencies, too.\n\nWhat we must not do, however, is move toward a balanced budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Sadly, that is the approach that virtually all Republicans and some Democrats are advocating. As the founder of the Defending Social Security Caucus, I look forward to working with other members of Congress, the AFL-CIO, senior and disability groups and the vast majority of people in our country who want to prevent cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs vitally important to the working families of America.\n\nIn my view, if the Republicans continue to play an obstructionist role, the president should get out of the Oval Office and travel the country. If he does that, I believe that he will find that there is no state in the country, including those that are very red, where people believe that it makes sense to continue giving huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. I have a strong feeling that when large numbers of constituents all across this country start calling and emailing their senators and members of Congress about this issue, the American people will win this fight.\n\nThe good news is that we are already beginning to see some Republicans make thoughtful comments showing they understand that elections have consequences. Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor, said Sunday that the Republican Party should accept new ideas, including the much criticized suggestion by Democrats that taxes be allowed to go up on the wealthy. “It won’t kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It really won’t, I don’t think. I don’t really understand why Republicans don’t take Obama’s offer.”\n\nKristol is right. At a time when the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider, common sense and justice require the people who are doing extremely well financially to help us in a significant way to reduce deficits.\n\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=77bf9eab-7011-4b11-a307-cc2be2b16e","2012-11-19 19:10:50+00","9124187907_198951753563422",10],[15967,"Sen.

And in advance of Veterans Day, Sanders and leaders of more than 50 veterans and seniors organizations made the case on Friday that any budget deal must not cut VA benefits. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=802E95B8-95A2-4EB1-B089-962FC9C0F266","2012-11-09 23:10:00+00","9124187907_423184544403676",10],[15996,"Coming up at 10:30amET: Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nVeterans' Benefits: Sen. Bernie Sanders is working to prevent cuts to veterans' benefits. Sanders, a senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, has written a letter to congressional leadership making the case against the use of policies to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for veteran's benefits and Social Security. So far, more than 35 organizations representing veterans, seniors and the disabled have signed onto the letter, according to The Associated Press. \n\nFiscal Crisis: Senior lawmakers moved quickly to take advantage of the postelection political atmosphere to try to strike an agreement that would avert a fiscal crisis early next year when trillions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts begin to go into force, but the forces arrayed against a budget deal remain powerful. Sen. Sanders, a standard-bearer for the left, told The New York Times that virtually all deficit reduction should come from tax increases on the rich, closing loopholes that have allowed profitable corporations to avoid paying any corporate income taxes and cutting military spending.\n\nTake it to the People: \"If we cannot reach an agreement in D.C., which is very likely, because the Republicans will continue to obstruct, I think the president has got to go around this country and say to those people in Oklahoma, in Mississippi, in Alabama, ‘Guess what? This is the issue. Tax breaks for the billionaires, you`re going to cut Social Security, what do you think? Call up your congressman, write to your senator.' We can win this debate,\" Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. \n\nPrize Fund: Sen. Sanders has proposed creating a billion-dollar prize for new pharmaceutical innovations. If you come up with something that solves some critical need, you'll get billions of dollars in prize money, partially funded by the private sector as well as the government. \"But the caveat is, if you win, you have to relinquish all kind o, intellectual property of your innovation. So you get the economic incentive to solve a big, pressing problem. But that eventual solution goes into circulation much faster and is cheaper and more accessible,\" author Steven Johnson told NPR's Talk of the Nation. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=3D0F690D-E298-4333-9C46-B3BF9835F794","2012-11-09 14:27:57+00","9124187907_166880726769320",10],[15998,"The Republican party is now an extreme right-wing party that is owned by their billionaire campaign contributors. http://youtu.be/TrYiR94Yjw4","2012-11-09 01:57:30+00","9124187907_526102120750866",10],[15999,"Coming up at 8pmET: Sen.

Bernie Sanders wants President Barack Obama to stay in campaign mode and use the momentum of his big re-election win to rally support for plans to preserve programs such as Social Security and require the wealthy pay more in taxes. \"The president said last night that maybe he's going to spend a little more time out of the Oval Office and go around the country, and I think that's an excellent idea,\" Sanders told the Burlington Free Press in an interview the day after the votes were tallied. \"We have got to put the right-wingers on the defense right now.\" Sanders said he hoped Republicans heard the message that Americans aren't interested in a government pushing extremist policies, according to a Brattleboro Reformer editorial.   \n                                                                                                \nA Mandate: \"What I believe the president of the United States has got to do is ... get up there and say, ‘Do you,' folks in Oklahoma, folks in Mississippi, or wherever, do you really want to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires?'\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday on The Ed Schultz Radio Show. \"Instead of sitting in the Oval Office and moving to the right, the president's got to go around the country and talk about the issues that, in fact, the overwhelming majority of the American people support; and demand that these people in the conservative states start putting pressure on their elected officials.\"\n\nGrand Bargain: President Obama will face challenges reaching a \"grand bargain\" on the deficit not only from the House where Republicans kept a majority but also from his own party in the Senate, where very few of the Democratic winners will feel like they owe their victory to Obama's coattails. Progressives already were disturbed before the election by rumors of back-room negotiations to offer concessions on Social Security or Medicare in exchange for Republicans yielding on tax rates for the high-income earners. Obama's remark in the first presidential debate that he and Republican challenger Mitt Romney had \"a somewhat similar position\" on Social Security sounded the alarm bell for Sen. Sanders, Marketwatch reported. \"For the president to say [his]... position is somewhat similar to Gov. Romney is very distressing,\" Sanders said.\n\nCitizens United: Sen. Sanders is pushing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would reverse the Citizens United decision that let corporations and wealthy individuals spend unlimited sums on campaigns. He noted that Sen. Sherrod Brown beat back millions in spending by the super PAC American Crossroads in an effort to unseat him in Ohio. ‘‘But he had to spend much more time raising money than he wanted to,'' Sanders told AP. ‘‘Even the good guys have to raise huge amounts of money to fight back.'' And some members of Congress allow their votes to be influenced by a fear of attack by super PACs the next time they're up for election, Sanders said in the article published by the Rutland Herald, Times Argus and Brattleboro Reformer. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=99882A7E-86B2-4627-87C6-B500550B5CDE","2012-11-08 14:31:38+00","9124187907_172542842885292",10],[16004,"Sign the petition to support Sen.

Bernie Sanders was reelected to the U.S. Senate, The Associated Press reported.\n\nA Vermont Victory: \"I have always believed that this small state, this state of Vermont, this state of three electoral votes, in many ways is going to lead our nation in a very different direction,\" Sanders said. \"I'm going to take the message back to Washington that we're going to end the war against working families, we're going to end the war against women, we're going to stand up for social justice, for environmental sanity, and we in Vermont are going to lead this nation to make sure that all of our people have health care as a right,\" Sanders said, according to the Vermont Press Bureau. \nSweeping Support Sanders' margin of victory was 71.2 percent.

There are ways to do deficit reduction by asking the wealthiest people and largest corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. By ending these absurd tax havens in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, where Romney and his friends are able to stash their money; we're losing about $150 billion a year on that. And I think we've got to take a hard look at the Defense Department and other agencies of government where we're probably spending more than we should.
