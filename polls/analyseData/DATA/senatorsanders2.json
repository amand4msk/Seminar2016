The top-line finding for the United States is that the share of pre-tax income going to the top 1 percent of earners continues to be the highest among OECD countries, standing at 19.3 percent in 2012.\n\nThis share has more than doubled since 1980.

The top 10 percent of wage earners are closing in on 50 percent of the pie, while the top 0.1 percent are taking in nearly 10 percent of the income. For some historical context, consider that the 0.1 percent now claim a larger share of income than the 1 percent did in the early '80s, and the 1 percent are now earning nearly as much as the top 5 percent did during the same period.

The day falls between the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the anniversary of the founding of Israel and, as such, both recalls the great struggle for survival of 20th century Jews, and the great event that came out of that struggle, namely the establishment of the state of Israel.\n \nIt is therefore fitting that we join in solidarity with Israel to remember the mothers and fathers, the brothers and sisters, the husbands and wives, the sons and daughters who perished in the Holocaust, and to celebrate the courage of those who resolved that the Nazis—like all those who attempted to annihilate the Jews in the past—would fail.\n \nIt is the great good fortune of the United States that Israel was established and has flourished beyond the wildest expectations to become a beacon in the Middle East of the limitless potential of a free society.  As a Texan, I am particularly encouraged by our close relationship in the energy sector, which will shortly enable Israel to become an energy exporter to neighbors like Egypt and Jordan.\n \nIsrael has also become a key security partner for America in the region assisting us with everything from counter-terrorism efforts to research and development on programs such as Iron Dome and Iron Beam—and most importantly standing firmly by our side to counter the looming threat of a nuclear Iran.\n \nOn this Holocaust Remembrance Day, our best way to affirm our commitment to “never again” is to present a united front with our close friend and ally Israel, and to express our vigorous support for the Jewish state and for Jews worldwide by focusing on our clear national security interest—which is continuing to guarantee Israel’s security through our unquestionable commitment to our friendship.","2014-04-28 21:38:03+00","315496455229328_536158756496429",14],[23553,"Texas to Toyota: Come on down! #GTT","2014-04-28 14:53:40+00","315496455229328_535959269849711",14],[23556,"Saint John Paul II is and always will be a force for courage against religious and political oppression, a brilliant defender of the sanctity of life, and an inspiring source of love amidst a world in turmoil.","2014-04-27 18:28:49+00","315496455229328_535524059893232",14],[23559,"Don’t let government get in the way of an American success story that provides limitless prosperity and opportunity — embrace the great American Energy Renaissance!","2014-04-24 20:12:18+00","315496455229328_533983410047297",14],[23560,"\"If you like your health plan, you might lose it.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nVermont Eyes Bigger Goal on Health Care: Vermont plans to launch the nation's first universal health care system, a sort of modified Medicare-for-all. It's an open question whether Vermont can work as a model for other states. \"Developing a single-payer system for Vermont is a lot easier than in California or Texas or New York,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, using a term to describe a system in which health care is paid for by a single entity. He has been pushing for some form of socialized medicine since he was mayor of Burlington 30 years ago, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSpying on Allies: In Washington on Saturday, demonstrators held up signs reading \"Thank you, Edward Snowden!\" as they rallied near the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress investigate the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance of Americans and eavesdropping on allied heads of state. “It sends a terrible message throughout the world. We’re saying we don’t really trust you,” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV in an interview on Friday.  He also called for legislation to limit the NSA’s wholesale collection of data on Americans who are not suspected of any wrongdoing. He called the NSA “out of control” and urged the spy agency to “stop this nonsense.”\n\nBudget Conference: Sen. Sanders is on the special budget conference committee that begins work this week on what could be a one-year plan to keep the government running when funding runs out in December. “I really don’t expect another government shutdown. I think Republicans have learned their lesson,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.\n\nBernie for President?: “We need voices in the national campaign to speak about the needs of working people,” Sanders told WCAX-TV in the Friday night interview, but he quickly added that “there are other fine people out there” and said that “it’s very unlikely” he will mount a campaign for the White House. On Vermont Public Television, Vermont This Week host Stewart Ledbetter mentioned that there is talk, “as far-fetched as it may sound,” of Sanders running for president. Running as a Democrat, Ledbetter added, “seems anathema to the senator from Vermont.” Radio host Mark Johnson also was dubious but said Sanders, when pressed, “hasn’t closed the door on it.”\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/102713","2013-10-27 15:01:32+00","9124187907_10151927882282908",15],[23573,"Happy San Jacinto Day!

America stands ready to welcome a free and peaceful Iran into a mutually-beneficial friendship.\n\nWhile Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, languishes in a brutal Iranian prison for the peaceful profession of his Christian faith, however, there should be no illusions that the regime of Hasan Rouhani is any more \"moderate\" than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The case of Pastor Saeed demonstrates the grim reality that under the genial veneer of cell phone chats and tweets, the cruelly oppressive and anti-American policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei are unchanged.\n\nPastor Saeed is, unfortunately, only one piece in the larger picture of human rights abuses in Iran.  Not only are he and his fellow Americans Amir Hekmati and Robert Levinson detained in Iran, but the regime has also increased its oppression of its own people.  Just this month, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Iran submitted a report detailing how the human rights crisis has worsened--not improved--since Rouhani's election, including spikes in executions and abuses of religious freedom.\n\nSome in the Obama administration believe human rights issues can be compartmentalized, or rather marginalized, in their quest to get a comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear program, and the administration has shown little interest in officially naming Iranian human rights abusers for sanctions.  I believe this is a mistake, and that we should be aggressively pursuing human rights abusers in Iran as we should in Russia.  At the very least the United States should demand the release of our unjustly detained citizens before we embrace a hostile foreign government as a legitimate diplomatic partner. \n\nThere could be no more positive step for both our countries than if all prisoners of conscience in Iran were immediately and unconditionally released on Nowruz, beginning with Saeed Abedini, and I urge all those observing the holiday to remember him in their prayers. #SaveSaeed","2014-03-20 19:15:25+00","315496455229328_515774028534902",14],[23685,"Terrific conversation with Midland business leaders about the Great American Energy Renaissance that is at our fingertips.","2014-03-20 14:19:10+00","315496455229328_515667455212226",14],[23687,"If we count on Washington, we’ll never turn this country around.

To hear Putin tell it in his address to the Duma, this action is not only perfectly legal, it also rights a historical wrong in which Russia was “robbed” of its rightful claim to the Crimean peninsula in 1954.\n\nPresident Obama has disputed the legality of these actions, observing that “President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations, but I don’t think that’s fooling anyone.” The reality, however, is that Putin is not concerned with international law or historical justice.  His sole focus is on correcting what he considers to be the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century” by reassembling the Soviet Union.   Ukraine is only a step in this process.  That is the real challenge the United States has to face, which we cannot do when we are agonizing over what our respective legal teams think.\n\nThere is an historical model we can consult for guidance in this crisis, as deterring Soviet aggression without engaging in military conflict was exactly what President Ronald Reagan had in mind when he proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative thirty-one years ago next Sunday.\n\nThe genius of SDI was that it did not recklessly attack the Soviets but rather neutralized their threat through our technological advantage.  Derided as a “Star Wars” style fantasy that was impossible to realize, President Reagan’s vision was a major component in the effort that brought down the Soviet Union without firing a shot, as no one ever started a war with a weapon called missile defense.\n\nThe Obama administration has unfortunately shown little enthusiasm for missile defense, beginning with the decision to cancel plans for a ballistic missile defense system in Central Europe, announced on the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 2009.  This pattern continued with the arbitrary and unnecessary concessions made to the Russians limiting our global deployment of missile defense in the New START that was implemented in 2011 and remains in force until 2021.\n\nMost recently, on March 14th the Government Accountability Office released a report titled “Regional Missile Defense: DOD’s Report Provided Limited Information; Assessment of Acquisition Risks is Optimistic.” It provides the depressing assessment that what missile defense programs we still have planned in Europe are going to be delayed to the tune of years because of technological glitches and cost overruns—a failure that would not have been tolerated if missile defense was a priority for the Commander in Chief.\n\nThis report could not have come at a more inopportune time, but perhaps it can serve as a wake-up call that President Obama’s policies on both Russia and missile defense have collapsed and should be immediately reversed through the following actions:\n\n1) The President should begin the process of withdrawing from New START according to the provision of Article XIV(3) of the Treaty, which declares “Each party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests;”\n\n2) The Secretary of Defense should engage in a full re-assessment of our missile defense posture in Europe with the purpose of restoring or expanding the installations cancelled in 2009; and\n\n3) The Secretary of Defense should, in conjunction with this work, engage in a thorough review of the delays and costs over-runs of the existing missile defense programs for Europe with the goal of accelerating their scheduled implementation.\n\nThese simple steps would send a clear and unequivocal signal to Vladimir Putin that the United States is unafraid to stand with our allies for our own national security interests.\n\nToday his sights are set on Ukraine, but if he continues undeterred tomorrow it could be Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Romania, the Czech Republic, or Poland.  Meeting his challenge now with strength, not appeasement, would be the best way to ensure that this does not happen, and that we do not squander our hard-won Cold War victory over the Soviets.","2014-03-19 17:37:36+00","315496455229328_10104332518340390",14],[23691,"Pass Obamacare they said.

After the United States won the Cold War and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991, many on both sides of the aisle believed that the Soviet threat to freedom was a thing of the past and that the new, democratic Russia would be a reasonable partner and even an ally.\n \nThe events of the last seventy-two hours demonstrate this is not case. Vladimir Putin barely waited for the flame of the Olympic torch in Sochi to be extinguished before he turned his attention to crushing the most recent attempt of the Ukrainian people to move towards freedom and the West. Despite warnings and expressions of concern from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Advisor, the Ambassador to the United Nations and even the President of the United States, Putin apparently feels he can act with impunity in what he considers to be his exclusive sphere of influence.\n \nHe has good reason to do so. Over the five years of his presidency, President Obama has done nothing to help the people of Georgia reclaim the some 20 percent of their sovereign territory that was violated by the 2008 Russian invasion, instead instructing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to attempt to “reset” the relationship with Russia in the hopes of pursuing more arms control agreements rather than forcefully defending American national security interests, and those of our allies. \n \nThis evening, President Obama spoke about his deep concerns about reports of Russian military action in Ukraine, and urged Putin not to violate international laws. But as the President and his national security team are apparently the last to learn, Putin has scant regard for international norms when they run counter to his goal of re-establishing Soviet-style regional hegemony over unfortunate states like Georgia and Ukraine who have the temerity to want a more free, prosperous future for their people. And Putin is under no illusions that the President’s vague threats mean any more than his infamous ‘red line’ in the Syrian desert.\n \nIf we were serious about standing up to Putin’s power grab, we would immediately suspend Russian membership in the Group of Eight (G-8), which should consist of nations that can contribute to a civilized order. And if the Russians persist in this aggressive action, we should look into additional measures such as suspension from the World Trade Organization and even the United Nations Security Council.\n \nThe United States stands with Ukraine.","2014-03-01 00:44:57+00","315496455229328_506662359446069",14],[23007,"Looking forward to kringle and Spotted Cow from Senator Tammy Baldwin to make that Dallas Cowboys victory tomorrow even sweeter!","2015-01-10 18:59:31+00","315496455229328_675253475920289",14],[23009,"Another attack on free speech--our ally Saudi Arabia needs to reject this brutality.","2015-01-08 22:46:08+00","315496455229328_674359006009736",14],[23011,"A snowy start to the 114th Congress.

Deplorable violence against the peaceful protests of Yanukovych’s unilateral decision to reject a popular trade agreement with the European Union and instead embrace closer ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia has already occurred on November 30, December 1 and December 11, 2013. Now this grim pattern is repeating itself. \n\nThe United States must not turn a blind eye to the struggle for freedom in a country where we have such a clear strategic interest. Putin’s proposed Eurasian Customs Union, of which Ukraine would be a cornerstone, is a thinly veiled attempt to re-assimilate the territory of \"greater Russia\" that made up the old Soviet Union. His offer of economic assistance is a first step in binding Ukraine to this new bloc. Given Ukraine’s economic and security significance to both the U.S. and our NATO allies in western Europe it would be a mistake to allow this expansion of Russia’s sphere of interest, especially given the tenacity with which Ukrainians have fought against it in recent months. \n\nThe President and Congress should unite in a coherent and sustained program to support the opposition and encourage Yanukovych to both rescind his restrictions on the rights of the Ukrainian people and renounce violence against those engaged in protest. I was pleased to co-sponsor Senate Resolution 319 introduced by Senator Chris Murphy on December 12, 2013, which includes the important clause: “in the event of further state violence against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress should consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against individuals responsible for ordering or carrying out the violence.” The Department of State should be commended for implementing visa bans against Ukrainian officials this week. We should follow-up swiftly with targeted economic sanctions as well, including freezing the assets of those responsible for the violence. \n\nThe people of Ukraine should know that the United States stands with them during this difficult time.","2014-01-23 23:13:58+00","315496455229328_10104128166902310",14],[23914,"The machinery of government shouldn’t be used against the citizenry or the President’s perceived political opponents. #IRS ","2014-01-23 17:02:49+00","315496455229328_10104127108069220",14],[23916,"The IRS is promulgating new rules that would silence the same groups it illegally targeted.

By waiving the individual mandate for millions of Americans – but not for all of us – President Obama has admitted what has been becoming more and more obvious: that Obamacare is a real hardship to those who are struggling.  \n\nMillions of Americans are losing their health insurance, losing their doctors, and facing skyrocketing premiums. The President should stop trying to pick winners and losers with healthcare; everyone deserves an exemption--the law should be repealed, and we should start over--because, as his latest admission demonstrates, Obamacare isn't working.","2013-12-20 21:48:09+00","315496455229328_474644592647846",14],[24002,"The single most important thing Congress can do to defend the national security interests of the United States is send a clear and unequivocal message that we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran that would pose an existential threat to our nation, the state of Israel, and our Gulf allies in the region. The United States must lead the international community to ensure the most dangerous regime in the world does not possess the world’s most dangerous weapon.\n\nI am pleased to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues on this resolution outlining a comprehensive deal with Iran that, if properly implemented, would represent a material degradation of Iran’s nuclear activities. The resolution also raises the important issue of Iran’s ballistic missile program, which is designed to deliver a nuclear weapon to the western hemisphere including the United States—an issue that is lamentably absent from the November 24, 2013, Joint Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear program. Majority Leader Harry Reid should listen to the thirteen members of his own caucus who have co-sponsored this Resolution and allow a vote on it before the end of the year.\n\nGiven the profound deficiencies in the deal reached in Geneva last month that this Resolution does not fully address, I am hopeful that Congress will also take additional action to curb Iran’s progress towards a nuclear weapon. Almost a month has passed since the JPA was agreed upon, and the timeline laid out in it has not even begun. We should consider at the very least making the six-month duration of the deal retroactive to November 24th, 2013 so that the Iranians do not take advantage of the ongoing negotiations to gain time.\n\nWe should also consider instructing the Treasury Department to increase its efforts to designate Iranian individuals and companies associated with that nation’s nuclear program and proliferation of WMD activities overseen by the IRGC (“Revolutionary Guard”) who are using deceptive practices to evade economic sanctions. Such action is in accordance with the current sanctions program; it is not affected by the JPA, and it would reduce the economic benefits the Iranian regime will enjoy from this interim agreement.\n\nThe Obama Administration has insisted the Geneva deal is an important opportunity to reach a greater rapprochement with Iran that will result in a comprehensive agreement regarding their nuclear program, and that any additional efforts at sanctions are “gratuitous” for its duration. Unfortunately, Iranian actions since November 24, 2013, including their temporarily walking out of negotiations in response to the United State enforcing existing sanctions not covered in the Geneva deal and the recent public declaration by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif that Iran retains the ability to resume uranium enrichment at a 20% level within 24 hours, are not encouraging, to say the least.\n\nIf this pattern continues, Congress should consider immediately suspending the proposed relaxation of sanctions under the JPA unless and until Iran actually halts its nuclear program. We should not be so naïve as to allow billions of additional dollars to flow into Iran while it is flouting its international commitments and actively pursuing nuclear weapons, to the detriment of our vital national security interests.","2013-12-20 14:59:50+00","315496455229328_474493205996318",14],[23965,"It's altogether fitting that President Obama is today talking about income inequality because income inequality has increased dramatically as a direct result of his economic policies.

The responsibility for the pain and suffering experienced by those children who are exploited by dangerous criminals and the associated burdens imposed on our border towns and cities now lies directly on Senate Democrats who would rather put hundreds of thousands more children and countless Americans at risk than stand up to the out-of-control and lawless president.","2014-08-01 02:36:51+00","315496455229328_586198554825782",14],[24038,"Another victim of Obamacare — your local volunteer fire department. \n\nObamacare isn’t working, it is hurting millions of Americans, and it is time for a #FullRepeal.","2013-12-11 16:55:34+00","315496455229328_470808209698151",14],[24039,"Watch and SHARE: Greta Van Susteren discusses our report on the lawless and abusive implementation of Obamacare.\n\nYou can read the report here: http://1.usa.gov/1buTAyn","2013-12-10 16:53:43+00","315496455229328_470344863077819",14],[24040,"Categorically refusing to enforce laws is the opposite of fulfilling the constitutional duty set forth by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution.

But they are hardly surprising. Such abuse was inevitable after this American citizen, whose only crime is the peaceful practice of his Christian faith, was transferred to Iran’s equivalent of death row—not coincidentally on the 34th anniversary of the hostage crisis in Tehran, a day celebrated by Iranians as 'Death to America Day.'\n\nIt is unconscionable that senior American diplomats, including the Secretary of State, who were conducting cordial negotiations with their Iranian counterparts in Geneva in the days after Pastor Saeed’s transfer, could not bring themselves to even mention his name, or those of fellow Americans detained in Iran, Amir Hekmati and Robert Levinson. We are informed by administration officials that the issue of the American prisoners is 'on the margins' of more important diplomatic work, and that in any event, President Obama mentioned Abedini and Hekmati to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani when they spoke by telephone in September.\n\nThe President’s action should not have been an end unto itself but rather the first step in a sustained effort to get these men home. Their unconditional release should be central, not peripheral, to any further agreement with Iran. If the United States was prepared to release an Iranian nuclear scientist, Mojtaba Atarodi, as a good faith gesture paving the way to direct negotiations between our two nations for the first time in more than thirty years, the Iranians should have been required to do at least as much. We should have told them up front that their detention of our citizens and hostile rhetoric against the United States and our ally Israel is unacceptable, rather than engaging, without preconditions, in a negotiation that will provide the Iranian regime substantial sanction relief while doing nothing to curb—let alone end—its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\n\nA recent Pew poll reveals that American’s confidence in our position in the world is at an all-time low. For the first time, a majority of Americans—some 53%—believe our global role is declining. Showing clear and decisive leadership on the American prisoners of conscience unjustly detained in hostile nations, including Cuba and North Korea as well as Iran, would be a good place to start reversing this trend.","2013-12-05 17:53:03+00","315496455229328_468257816619857",14],[23051,"Our nation was founded on a revolutionary concept: no man is above the law.

Toxic gasses filled the air; planes swooped below; and machine guns buzzed well into the night. In the first two days, the Division lost roughly 1,600 men. But they kept fighting, held the line, and captured over 600 enemy soldiers. The Texas troops forced the Germans to concede a primary stronghold, which proved to be a critical step in winning the war.\n \nA month later, on November 11, 1918, Germany signed an armistice ending the Great War, and ever since we have commemorated our veterans on this day.\n \nEach person who serves in the Armed Forces deserves our utmost gratitude – they pledge their lives so that we might remain free. Today we honor them.\n \nTexans have always been proud of our troops who, like those who charged the dark forest of Blanc Mont Ridge, defend liberty in the most harrowing circumstances.\n \nJust shy of a century since that most fateful night, the men and women of Texas continue to serve with great courage and commitment.\n \nNinety Texans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the United States’ highest recognition of personal bravery. Thousands have volunteered to defend our nation since 9-11, and hundreds have given their lives in the war against terrorism. In the past year, over 17,500 Texans have joined the Armed Forces. With over 200,000 active duty personnel, reservists, National Guardsmen, and civilians at 15 military institutions across the state, Texans play a critical role in keeping Americans safe and free.\n \nToday, service members from Dyess Air Force base are conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets. ISIS is the face of evil. It is persecuting Christians. It is beheading children. It is pillaging towns. And Dyess Air Force base is playing a critical role in exterminating this evil.\n \nToday, troops from Fort Bliss and Fort Hood are deploying to Africa and fighting the spread of what Texans have unfortunately already witnessed to be the deadly disease of Ebola. These soldiers are going into the thick of the epidemic and risking their own wellbeing to end this outbreak. We are grateful for their swift response.\n \nToday, the Texas National Guard has stepped up to secure the border and protect citizens from dangerous illegal criminals that only perpetuate the humanitarian crisis on the border. They are on the front lines of saving lives on American soil. In one case, just over a month ago, three National Guard soldiers rescued a Texan who was injured along the river. He was bleeding profusely, but with their swift response, he survived and has recovered.\n \nToday, bases from Shepperd to Goodfellow to Camp Bullis train our next generation of pilots, medics, and ground troops. Bases scattered throughout the state ensure that the future of our military is strong, and that the young men and women who pledge their lives to defend this nation are well-trained and equipped. These training programs provide them a future of service and opportunity, and in turn, these young soldiers safeguard our national security interests.\n \nToday we recognize a life-long Texan, Richard Overton, who at 108 is the oldest living American World War Two veteran – we thank him for his continued patriotism.\n \nThese are only a handful of examples highlighting the robust military presence in the Lone Star State. There are countless told and untold stories of the heroes in the state. Let us never forget to tell them.\n \nThis spirit of courage lives on in Texas, and it is with grateful hearts that today we say thank you to all the men and women who have served our country. So today, take a minute to call a service member you know or shake the hand of a veteran. Thank them for their sacrifice. It’s an honor to know them. And let us never forget the price they pay so that we may enjoy the many blessings of liberty.","2014-11-11 13:53:25+00","315496455229328_642302229215414",14],[23100,"Twenty-five years ago today, the world changed when the seemingly-impenetrable wall between East and West Germany was torn down by a people determined to break the stranglehold of totalitarian Communism.\n \nThe goal of the Soviet Union was to obliterate the very principle of freedom and to establish a global network of oppression under which all individuals were subjugated to a state that cared only about its own survival.  “It has no laws. All it has is power—power to arrest and torture, with or without laws,” as the survivor of the Soviet gulag Alexander Solzhehitsyn wrote.\n \nIt was a brutal campaign, and it almost worked.  More than 100 million people lost their lives in less than a century.  Untold numbers slaved away in work camps under horrific conditions.  From Latin America to Africa to southeast Asia, supporters of Communism were on the march.  The Soviets seemed so powerful that the only option for America and our allies seemed to be to reach some sort of accommodation with them. \n \nBut then a new American president charted a different course.  He proposed a simple paradigm of “We win, they lose.” In 1987, Ronald Reagan stood in front of the grim barrier that had been erected in 1961 to forcibly contain the freedom represented by West Berlin and demanded its removal, “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization…Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” With his allies, those tireless advocates for religious and economic freedom Pope John Paul II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, President Reagan refused to accept the tyranny of Communism as inevitable.\n \nLess than a year after Ronald Reagan left office, his vision became a reality.  No wall could hold back the waves of protest that swept from the Baltic through eastern Europe.  On November 9, 1989, freedom prevailed. Where once armed guards and barbed wire kept terrified citizens under Soviet control, a peaceful nation, a friend of the United States, began to flourish.\n \nIt might be tempting to imagine of this trajectory as part of a preordained evolution towards liberal democracy and conclude that the bad old days of the Soviet Union are a thing of the past.  But the events of the last year have demonstrated that this is very far from the truth.  Evil may have been defeated in Berlin twenty-five years ago, but it was not eradicated.  An aggressive Russia is once again massing in the region, threatening to extinguish the hard-fought gains of the millions of people whose most cherished dream was to live in freedom.    \n \nSo rather than greeting this anniversary with self-congratulatory complacency, a renewed resolve is called for.

Today, we commemorate that moment by thanking our veterans who have continued the quest to preserve our peace and freedom.\n\nWe should all be proud of our country’s long tradition of service. General John J. Pershing eloquently expressed his thanks in a letter to the troops who helped win the “war to end all wars,” that is just as relevant now as it was then.\n\nPershing wrote, “By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor, strength and indomitable will, made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation, you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.”\n\nWe are so fortunate that throughout history, millions of Americans have come forward to fight tyrants, fascists, communists, and terrorists to keep us free.\n\nStill, we live in a violent world, where the freedoms we enjoy remain exceptional to millions of less fortunate forced to abide by brutal dictators, oppressive regimes, and cultures of intolerance.\n\nThe persistent threats of terrorism at home and abroad are reminders of how precious it is to be an American and how fiercely our rights must be protected.\n\nWe are blessed to live in a society where men and women continue to fight for our flag. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, more than 3 million Americans have volunteered to defend their country, knowing full well the risks they may face. More than 50,000 are serving in Afghanistan right now.\n\nThey, like millions of veterans before them, are willingly putting themselves in danger to keep us safe.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge once said, “The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.” He was right.\n\nPlease join me on this Veterans Day in saying a prayer of thanks for our veterans. And, please find a veteran. Grab their hand. Look them in the eye and tell them, “Thank you for your service.”\n\nWe will never be able to express enough thanks for the troops, but they must always know they are treasured.\n\nMay God bless the veterans, may God bless all those who continue to protect our country, and may God bless the United States of America.","2013-11-11 16:54:18+00","315496455229328_457540927691546",14],[24133,"Wishing a very happy birthday to the United States Marine Corps.

We should have insisted on good-faith measures before meeting with the Iranians directly, such as the release of Pastor Saeed Abedini and the acknowledgment of Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu has taken the extraordinary step of condemning what is happening in Geneva as a 'very, very bad deal.'

But in spite of all Texas has done to resist the biggest entitlement program of this generation, Obamacare is reducing health care options, increasing costs and hurting jobs. It has no place in Texas and must be repealed so we can empower Americans and their families by offering real health care choices rather than a government-written menu of plans they don't want and can't afford.\n\nPresident Obama should take his broken promises tour elsewhere so Texans can continue focusing on the solutions that have allowed our state to become and remain the nation's economic and job creation powerhouse.","2013-11-06 20:18:36+00","315496455229328_454969014615404",14],[24156,"SHARE if you agree Obamacare is a disaster and should be repealed entirely! #MakeDCListen","2013-11-06 15:15:05+00","315496455229328_454705714641734",14],[24158,"I am proud to stand with Senator John Cornyn remembering the American heroes killed and injured in Nidal Hasan's terrorist attack at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009 and pushing for the Fort Hood Heroes Act to recognize their sacrifice and ensure victims and family members are provided the benefits they deserve.","2013-11-05 23:02:55+00","315496455229328_454306028015036",14],[24159,"Yesterday we learned that Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, was transferred abruptly and without explanation from Iran’s Evin prison in Tehran to the even more brutal Rajai Shahr prison in Karaj. Pastor Saeed’s cruel imprisonment for peacefully practicing his Christian faith has gone on for more than a year. During this time it has been inspirational to see the courage and faith professed by his wife Naghmeh, and to hear her account of how, even under such duress, Pastor Saeed has continued his ministry and converted as many as thirty of his fellow prisoners at Evin.\n\nPastor Saeed’s situation has, however, now reached a crisis point. The prison at Karaj houses violent criminals on death row, and is infamous for the abuse of political prisoners. One international observer reported in 2005 that “Going to Karaj is a severe punishment. Once in there one stops to be a human being.” Conditions have not improved since then. Our first priority has to be to get Pastor Saeed out of these terrible circumstances. The International Red Cross should be granted access to him, and he should be promptly liberated.\n\nBut once the immediate danger to Pastor Saeed is relieved, the larger issue is that such human rights outrages have no place in the civilized exchange between nations. Many Americans have been hopeful in recent months that the new president of Iran, Hasan Rouhani, would be a more moderate partner and work with the United States to peacefully resolve the international crisis over Iran’s nuclear program. Indeed, historic bi-lateral negotiations are slated to resume in Geneva later this week based on the perception that there has been a material improvement in Iran’s historically hostile posture towards the United States and our allies.\n\nUnfortunately, this harsh persecution of an American – made, not coincidentally, on the 34th anniversary of the illegal seizure of American hostages in Iran – could hardly be more clearly designed to send the opposite message. It is difficult to see how the Obama administration can engage in good-faith talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran under these circumstances.\n\nPresident Obama should be commended for raising the issue of Pastor Saeed’s release in his telephone call with President Rouhani on September 27th. Given this recent action, I hope President Obama now takes that request one step further and demands his release as a precondition to any further negotiations. The Iranians should not be allowed to try to leverage Pastor Saeed’s his release into American concessions over sanctions. Rather, the President should make it clear that it is incumbent on the Iranians to demonstrate through this action that the rhetoric of their new president is more than mere lip service to gain economic relief. I am sure all my colleagues who value religious freedom would be proud to stand with the President in this effort.\n\nIt is time for Iran to stop the chants of ‘Death to America’ and start freeing the many prisoners of conscience suffering in unjust captivity in that country, starting with Saeed Abedini.","2013-11-05 22:34:59+00","315496455229328_454286301350342",14],[24161,"Obamacare should be repealed entirely -- AGREE or DISAGREE?\n\nCOMMENT with what you think!","2013-11-05 18:40:33+00","315496455229328_454048071374165",14],[24163,"Enjoyed welcoming St. John's School's seventh grade class to our nation's capital today.

Most are ending policies sold after the law passed in March 2010. At least a few are cancelling plans sold to people with pre-existing medical conditions.”\n\nPresident Obama is sure to promise Americans that with more time, taxpayer money, and patience the law will perform better. Its failings, however, are not limited to its website or its rollout.\n\nWe already know Obamacare can’t live up to its promises. President Obama promised Americans that their premiums would go down, taxes would stay low, millions of jobs would be created, and if they liked their healthcare plans, they could keep them. Instead, premiums are rising, taxes are higher, the economy is sputtering, and people are losing their plans.\n\nObamacare is the nation’s biggest job killer and stands in the way of our country’s economic growth and prosperity. It should be defunded and repealed. President Obama should hear the pleas from the untold number of Americans who are losing their jobs, wages, and healthcare plans, and Congress should act immediately to stop Obamacare from inflicting any more damage on the country on our hard-working citizens.","2013-10-21 15:34:52+00","315496455229328_446005165511789",14],[24243,"I'm honored to work for the people of Texas.

Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats to fully fund Obamacare was yet the latest example of Washington not listening to the people.\n\nObamacare is a 'train wreck,' a 'nightmare,' to use the words of its Democratic author and a union leader who previously supported the bill. It is the biggest job killer in America.\n\nAs Teamsters President James Hoffa explained in a letter to Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Obamacare is hurting 'millions of working men and women ... and the families they support,' and it 'will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.'\n\nSenate Democrats refused to listen.\n\nPresident Obama has granted exemptions for big business and Members of Congress, but Senate Democrats refuse to grant the American people the same exemption. Instead, they used political power to maintain their privileged position while doing nothing to respond to the pleas of millions of Americans.\n\nBut this fight continues. Now the bill returns to the House. The House showed remarkable courage voting to defund Obamacare, and I hope and believe that the House will stand by their resolve and continue to lead the effort to stop the Obamacare train wreck.\n\nObamacare is killing jobs, forcing people into part-time work, causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket, and threatening the healthcare of millions of Americans.\n\nToday, far too many Republicans joined Harry Reid in giving the Democrats the ability to fund Obamacare. When the bill comes back to the Senate, when the House yet again stands for principle and fights for the American people, I very much hope that Senate Republicans will rise to the challenge. We are stronger when we are united, and we can defeat Obamacare only if Senate Republicans come together, stand with House Republicans, and champion the millions of Americans being harmed by this disastrous healthcare law.\n\n#MakeDCListen","2013-09-27 17:49:28+00","315496455229328_432484376863868",14],[24380,"A yes vote on cloture today is a vote with Harry Reid to allow him to fund Obamacare #DefundObamacare #MakeDCListen #DontBlink","2013-09-27 14:23:43+00","315496455229328_432408240204815",14],[24368,"Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had the opportunity this afternoon to avert a government shutdown. Instead, he chose to kill the House’s bill to keep government open, a deliberate act to move towards a government shutdown. This is no surprise. After the House acted Saturday night, Sen. Reid refused to call the Senate back to service, instead leaving senators at home on vacation while a shutdown loomed. And he has apparently advised the President not to meet with House and Senate leaders of both parties. Harry Reid wants a shutdown, because, sadly, Democrats are putting politics above the needs of the American people. The New York Times explained why: because, as the Democrats believe “now is the time to break the power of Tea Party Republicans.\"\n\nThis is exactly the kind of DC-based thinking that makes Americans disdain Washington, DC. Democrats need to listen to the people and start working for the millions of Americans who are losing their jobs, wages, and healthcare benefits because of Obamacare. This is not a debate over a government shutdown; it’s a debate about how Obamacare is plaguing our economy.

He took particular issue with the end of the President’s statement:\n\n“But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That’s what makes America different. That’s what makes us exceptional.“\n\nMr. Putin worries that it is “extremely dangerous” for the President to encourage the Americans to see themselves as exceptional. His concern is well placed. Historically it has not boded well for autocrats when Americans are clearly focused on the values and principles that have made our nation great:\n\nWhen millions of men, women and children were being systematically gassed in Nazi concentration camps, Americans fought to end the slaughter, with 405,399 of our “greatest generation” sacrificing their lives to defeat Fascism.\n\nWhen millions of men, women, and children were being brutalized in Soviet gulags, Americans on both sides of the political aisle rallied together to fight the Cold War. After decades of struggle, the Iron Curtain crumbled and 286,730,819 people were freed from the yoke of Communism.\n\nBoth of these efforts, which not coincidentally were also firmly in the national security interests of the United States, were the two greatest acts of liberation in the history of the planet.\n\nEven at the risk of discomfiting Mr. Putin further, I hope President Obama amplifies his remarks on American exceptionalism as we engage in the ongoing debate on Syria. We live in a great country where citizens can criticize their President and not fear a visit from the secret police. As Americans we can agree that to disagree over weighty issues and still stand united in the defense of freedom.

At the end of the day the inspection regime we all know about the 24-days notice, which is a delay that is designed only to give the Iranian regime time to cover up their nuclear program.\n\nBut hearing the specific details, this deal is not materially different than simply calling the Iranian supreme leader, asking if they're developing nuclear weapons, and taking his word for it when he says ‘no.' \n\nThe idea that we would trust Iran to inspect their own facilities takes a level of gullibility and naiveté that exceeds the standards even of the Obama Administration.

And the focus in particular, should be on Senate Democrats and Congressional Democrats because they face a fundamental choice: Will they put first the national security of our country, the safety and security of our friends and allies, the safety and security of the Nation of Israel, and the lives of millions of Americans? Or will they put first, instead, partisan loyalty to the Obama White House. I very much hope and pray we see a reemergence of Joe Lieberman Democrats, we see a reemergence of Scoop Jackson Democrats, of John F. Kennedy Democrats, of Democrats who say ‘My first priority is representing and defending the United States of America and keeping this nation first trumps any level of partisan loyalty.'

In Great Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has called the House of Commons home from vacation to deliberate over the use of force in Syria. In Israel, the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is reviewing potential responses should Israel be attacked in the fallout over action in Syria.\n\nIn Washington, DC, crickets are chirping.\n\nIt may be that there is a compelling case to be made that intervention in Syria is necessary to defend U.S. interests. But to date no such case has been made by President Obama, leaving those of us in Congress with some serious questions.\n\nThe President has in the past insisted that Assad must go, but this week his press secretary insisted that regime change is not part of any planned action in Syria. Given this lack of strategic consistency, Congress has every right to ask what the basic purpose of this action would be? On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed certainty that the Assad regime was responsible for the attack, but today we are learning there are outstanding questions about who actually ordered it and who controls the weapons. Given this confusion, Congress has every right to ask what the basis is for action at this time? In a press interview yesterday, the President said that the “very limited” action he is considering “may have a positive impact on our national security.” Given this modest mandate and uncertain outcome, Congress has every right to ask why we are considering this action at all?\n\nAccording to the Constitution, only Congress has the authority to declare war. While the Commander in Chief must have the flexibility to act in the event of an imminent threat, the President's comments suggest this does not currently exist in Syria. There is time for debate, and no more important subject for Congress to consider. Deploying our armed forces is a serious commitment of the highest order, and we should only consider it in cases where our vital national security interests are at stake. Our allies have demonstrated a willingness to do proper due diligence on this issue. We owe it to the men and women in our armed forces, who would execute this mission, to do no less. When and if President Obama makes a decision on Syria, he must immediately call a special session of Congress and persuade the American people that what he proposes is critical to the defense of our nation.

By refusing to rule if the States can define marriage, the Supreme Court is abdicating its duty to uphold the Constitution. The fact that the Supreme Court Justices, without providing any explanation whatsoever, have permitted lower courts to strike down so many state marriage laws is astonishing.\n \nThis is judicial activism at its worst. The Constitution entrusts state legislatures, elected by the People, to define marriage consistent with the values and mores of their citizens.  Unelected judges should not be imposing their policy preferences to subvert the considered judgments of democratically elected legislatures.\n \nThe Supreme Court is, de facto, applying an extremely broad interpretation to the 14th Amendment without saying a word – an action that is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Because of the Court’s decision today, 11 States will likely now be forced to legalize same-sex marriage: Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. And this action paves the way for laws prohibiting same-sex marriage to be overturned in any state.\n \nIt is beyond dispute that when the 14th Amendment was adopted 146 years ago, as a necessary post-Civil War era reform, it was not imagined to also mandate same-sex marriage, but that is what the Supreme Court is implying today. The Court is making the preposterous assumption that the People of the United States somehow silently redefined marriage in 1868 when they ratified the 14th Amendment.\n \nNothing in the text, logic, structure, or original understanding of the 14th Amendment or any other constitutional provision authorizes judges to redefine marriage for the Nation. It is for the elected representatives of the People to make the laws of marriage, acting on the basis of their own constitutional authority, and protecting it, if necessary, from usurpation by the courts.\n \nMarriage is a question for the States.

But growing economic segregation—the increasing tendency of affluent people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is affluent, and poor people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is poor—may be a more insidious problem.

Unfortunately, the current farm bill gives far less attention to the needs of farmers than it does to politicians and special interests. For an issue as critical to our nation's safety and American livelihoods as ensuring a reliable food supply, I am disappointed that Washington's cynical politics have again trumped any real reform.\n\nAny meaningful support for farmers in this trillion dollar bill is unnecessarily held hostage to the unchecked growth of food stamp entitlements and numerous other programs unrelated to farming. This farm bill costs 60 percent more than the 2008 bill. Nearly 80 percent of it is comprised of food stamps. It fails to provide a true safety net for difficult years, fails to fully target assistance to those most in need, and fails to prioritize farm aid over duplicative programs, subsidizing unrelated programs from green energy to housing.\n\nWe should address the true needs of American farmers, but the bill considered by the Senate does much more harm than good.

We have seen the face of that enemy time and again, most recently in the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood, Benghazi and Boston to name a few.\n\nBut on one hand the Obama Administration says this enemy is in retreat, yet on the other, they are implementing what appears to be an unprecedented and intrusive surveillance system on private American citizens in the name of guarding against that enemy. Just today, the president encouraged us to trust him on this – to trust that there are safeguards to ensure our privacy is protected, trust that there is a system of checks and balances to prevent an abuse of power. But in light of this Administration's track record, how can they expect to be trusted?\n\nWe have discovered over the past few months an ongoing pattern of wanton disregard not only for Americans' privacy, but for the truth – DOJ's refusal to be forthcoming about drone policy, IRS's targeting groups for their political beliefs and then misleading the American people about it, DOJ's targeting of journalists for doing their jobs, and now what seems an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' personal phone records and potentially into their broader online activities.\n\nAmericans trusted President Obama when he came to office promising the most transparent administration in history.

Two companies, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., brought separate cases in different courts, but the cases are being heard together at the Supreme Court. Hobby Lobby is an Oklahoma-based chain of craft stores; Conestoga Wood is a cabinet maker based in Pennsylvania. The business owners claim that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which provides that the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” – allows a for-profit, secular corporation to deny its employees health insurance coverage for contraceptives.  Making the case for women’s rights, Sen. Bernie Sanders joined a group of senators in a friend-of-the-court brief rebutting the businesses’ contention. The senators’ legal brief said the religious freedom law did not extend rights to non-religious, for-profit corporations.  They told the Supreme Court that letting a company disobey the health care law would undermine the government’s interest in providing women access to preventive health care, including contraceptive coverage.  Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act already contains protections for nonprofit religious organizations who do not wish to provide such coverage.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/womens-rights-religious-rights-corporate-rights","2014-03-18 22:00:00+00","9124187907_10101562782488219",15],[27512,"Childhood Poverty in America:\n\nThe childhood poverty rate in the United States is greater than in any other major country.

Dianne Feinstein, the panel chairwoman and one of the CIA’s staunchest defenders, accused the CIA of withholding information about its use of torture in the interrogation of prisoners. She also accused the spy agency of trying to intimidate committee staff members investigating the interrogation program. To Sen. Bernie Sanders, the revelation was “another sign that our intelligence community is out of control and that there must be greater oversight by Congress,” the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. Earlier this year, in response to a question from Sanders, the National Security Agency did not expressly deny spying on Congress, The Nation noted.\n\nHealth Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders tried Tuesday to revive debate about whether there would be benefit to involving the federal government more deeply in the nation’s medical system. The Vermont independent highlighted at a hearing how the United States spends more on health care than many other nations that have more extensive government involvement in their medical systems, but doesn’t seem to achieve better results than they do, Congressional Quarterly reported. Former Taiwanese health minister Ching-Chuan Yeh told a Senate hearing that Americans could learn from Taiwan’s example, Taiwan’s China Times and Taiwan Today reported. Yeh became the first Taiwanese Cabinet-level official to testify at a United States Senate hearing, the Central News Agency reported.\n\nObama Will Seek Overtime Pay Expansion: President Obama this week will seek to force American businesses to pay more overtime to millions of workers, the latest move by his administration to confront corporations that have had soaring profits even as wages have stagnated. On Thursday, the president will direct the Labor Department to revamp its regulations to require overtime pay for several million additional fast-food managers, loan officers, computer technicians and others whom many businesses currently classify as “executive or professional” employees to avoid paying them overtime, according to The New York Times.\n\nVA Budget: The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing to discuss funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, roughly one week after President Obama proposed boosting the VA budget by 3 percent. Secretary Eric Shinseki is slated to testify. The Senate last month rejected a sweeping bill sponsored by Sanders, the committee chairman, that would have expanded benefits for former service members and repealed a controversial pension cut for future troops, The Washington Post reported online.\n\nContinue reading today's news: http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031214","2014-03-12 13:30:25+00","9124187907_10152088572792893",15],[24861,"\"This administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security.

We know today that there are over a hundred Americans who have joined ISIS, who have taken up arms alongside the Jihadists, along with thousands of others from the European Union. And we also know that they are trying to return to their countries of origin to carry out terrorist attacks there. We know this because on May 24, an ISIS member returned to Belgium, where he attacked innocent visitors at a Jewish museum, slaughtering four people. And it was reported today that he had been plotting an even larger attack on Paris on Bastille Day. In addition, on August 11 of this year, an accused ISIS sympathizer, Donald Ray Morgan, was arrested at JFK airport trying to reenter the United States. We know that this threat is real.\n\nThat is why I have today filed legislation, the Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014, which would amend the existing statute governing renunciation of United States citizenship to designate fighting for a hostile foreign government or foreign terrorist organization as an affirmative renunciation of citizenship. By fighting for ISIS, U.S. citizens have expressed their desire to become citizens of the Islamic State, and that cannot and will not peacefully coexist with remaining American citizens. The desire to become a citizen of a terrorist organization that has expressed a desire to wage war on the American people, has demonstrated a brutal capacity to do so, murdering American civilians on the global stage and promising to bring that Jihad home to America. We should not be facilitating their efforts by allowing fighters fighting alongside ISIS to come back to America with American passports and walk freely in our cities to carry out unspeakable acts of terror. It is my hope that the legislation I'm introducing today will earn support on both sides of the aisle, that we will see this body come together and say while there are many partisan issues that divide us, when it comes to protecting United States citizens from acts of terror, we are all as one.","2014-09-08 20:35:12+00","315496455229328_609198809192423",14],[23215,"Venezuela -- a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- is set to import oil due to the catastrophic socialist policies of Chavez and Maduro.","2014-09-06 21:18:56+00","315496455229328_607557612689876",14],[23217,"Americans who choose to go to Syria or Iraq to fight with vicious ISIS terrorists are party to a terrorist organization committing horrific acts of violence, including beheading innocent American journalists who they have captured.\n\nThere can be no clearer renunciation of their citizenship in the United States, and we need to do everything we can to preempt any attempt on their part to re-enter our country and carry out further attacks on American civilians.","2014-09-05 17:40:29+00","315496455229328_606507022794935",14],[23219,"Great discussion in Sugar Land today about why it's so important we #StopObamasAmnesty and #SecureTheBorder.","2014-09-03 22:07:39+00","315496455229328_604734942972143",14],[23221,"Never-ending gratitude for the sacrifices of all those killed or severely hurt in the line of duty who received the Star of Texas Award today.

We perform different tasks, but the spirit is the same. We are proud of work and ashamed of idleness.  With us there is no task which is menial, no service which is degrading. All work is ennobling and all workers are ennobled.\"\n\nToday, too many Americans who want work are deprived of that opportunity.\n\nThe nominal unemployment rate is 6.2%.\n\nThe number of unemployed is 9.7 million.\n\nThe number of Americans who want work but have stopped looking is 2.2 million, and the number of discouraged Americans who have given up looking for work is 741,000.\n\nThe number of underemployed Americans is 19.4 million.  These are people who are unemployed (9.7 million), want work but have stopped searching for a job (2.2 million), or are working part time because they cannot find full time employment (7.5 million).\n\nThe labor force participation rate is 62.9 percent--the lowest level of participation since 1978.\n\nThe number of Americans not in the labor force is still over 92 million Americans, as 11,472,000 million Americans have left the workforce since President Obama took office.\n\nThese are not mere statistics—these represent real people, real families, people who have had their hopes and dreams crushed by a President and Democrats in Congress whose faith in Progressive politics will not be changed by the facts—their economic policies are a failure.\n\nWe can grow our way out of this problem. Ronald Reagan helped us do it in the 1980s and we can to it again now.\n\nIf the economy had recovered at the pace of Reagan’s recovery the  economy would be $2.2 trillion larger this year.  It's all because he put his faith in America's workers to make their own decisions that unleashed a new era of prosperity for the nation.\n\nPresident Obama has done the opposite and because of destructive Obama  policies, the economy has lost $6.4 trillion cumulatively since the recession ended--$20,388 per person.\n\nWe owe it to the American people to get the economy going again.  Many look for some silver bullet or innovative policy proposal, but it all goes to one basic question: Whom do you trust more, the government, or the workers?\n\nI trust the workers. The American worker is what has made our nation the envy of the world. American workers create jobs, growth, and opportunities for themselves and the next generation. And, it is the American worker who deserves our confidence, support, and respect once again.","2014-09-01 13:10:27+00","315496455229328_602492423196395",14],[23225,"I wanted to give a message to our students: seize the opportunities that come with each academic year.

It has now become one of the best-selling cosmetic companies in the country.\n\nIn the 1970’s, Willie Nelson moved back to Texas. After being inspired by the emerging rock and jazz scene in Austin, he broke the mold of Tennessee country and created an untried genre now known as outlaw country. His record sales soon sky-rocketed, he emerged as one of the great American icons, and today, we consider albums like “Texas in My Soul” to be Lone Star staples.\n\nIn the 1980’s, when everyone said the oil boom was finished, pioneers like George Mitchell refused to accept that the Texas soil was done giving, and he spent years innovating ways to crack the Barnett Shale, which eventually resulted in hydraulic fracturing, a practice that continues to revolutionize our nation’s energy supply and lead to more energy independence.\n\nIt was through their determined and innovative spirit that a floodgate of job opportunities opened to countless Texans and Americans.\n\nThere’s nothing stopping you from doing the same.\n\nYou are fortunate to have parents and grandparents who have made sacrifices so that you may succeed, and teachers who work long hours to make sure you learn as much as possible.

First, the U.S., the wealthiest country on the planet, is the only major industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its citizens.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nGlobal Warming All-Nighter: Sen. Bernie Sanders will help lead an overnight session of the Senate’s Climate Action Task Force in what he terms a wake-up call on global warming. Sanders — co-sponsor of a bill that would tax carbon and methane emissions — will be joined by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Maine Sen. Angus King and two dozen other task force members. The overnight session will take place on the Senate floor Monday night through Tuesday morning, The Associated Press reported.\n\nToomey Votes Against Veterans: “Despite proclaiming himself a champion of veterans and making grandiose statements about our society's obligation to take care of them, Sen. [Pat] Toomey was one of 41 Senators - all Republicans - who defeated a recent bill that would have expanded veterans' benefits … Veterans are furious. Veteran Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said … he'd be working hard in the upcoming weeks to convince the necessary number of Republicans to reconsider their votes. We urge Sen. Toomey to distinguish himself and honor his commitment to military veterans by being one of the Republicans who does just that,” The Philadelphia Daily News editorialized. \n\nLong-Term Unemployment: Both Democrats and Republicans offered up fresh proposals this week that would renew emergency unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless, injecting another batch of uncertainty into the debate. Democrats’ six-month proposal would use a large portion of the farm law’s savings to cover the $12 billion price tag, an unpopular option among Republicans. The Republican plan would combine several offsets to pay for a $10-billion, five-month measure that includes some program reforms.  Both bills would extend benefits retroactively to Dec. 28, when long-term unemployment insurance expired, The Hill reported. \n\nComcast Cash on Capitol Hill:  The Philadelphia cable giant, historically a major Beltway player, is sure to strengthen its political offense in order to sell $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable. Comcast has donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it. They know that the money they give to both Republicans and Democrats buys them access — everybody admits that in Washington today,” Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, told Politico. “So they have covered their bases by giving to nearly every single member of the committees that do oversight.” Dueling bills to renew a federal unemployment benefits program could trip up efforts to get legislation passed in the Senate.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031014","2014-03-10 13:16:19+00","9124187907_10101548696955739",15],[25014,"After failing to plan ahead for the sequester, the FAA this week has chosen the most burdensome path and refuses to explain why -- so this weekend employees will be furloughed, many air traffic control towers will close, and passengers may face long delays.","2013-04-19 19:45:25+00","315496455229328_360795507366089",14],[25016,"Looking forward to speaking with Mark Levin tonight at 7:30 PM CT. \n\nHope you'll tune in or listen online: http://www.marklevinshow.com","2013-04-18 23:30:01+00","315496455229328_360454744066832",14],[25018,"Anyone looking for information or assistance with the West explosion may dial the Texas Information Referral Network at 2-1-1. \n\nIf you'd like to donate to the Texas Disaster Relief Fund, please visit www.texasdisasterrelieffund.org or call 1-866-463-7982.","2013-04-18 18:40:14+00","315496455229328_360351644077142",14],[25021,"How to Help the West, TX Victims:","2013-04-18 11:00:50+00","315496455229328_360231887422451",14],[25023,"Assault weapons ban fails.

This is as diverse and bipartisan array of members of Congress as you will see on any topic and yet we are all unified in saying commonsense reforms need to be enacted to our criminal justice system. Right now today far too many young men, in particular African American young men, find their lives drawn in with the criminal justice system, find themselves subject to sentences of many decades for relatively minor non-violent drug infractions. We’ve seen the impact of these kind of reforms in the states, the states are laboratories of democracy. My home state of Texas implemented similar reforms and from 2005 the state of Texas has seen a 22 percent decrease in crime and a 12 percent decrease in expenditures on criminal justice. These are basic common sense. It’s also a matter of justice.\n \nAll of us agree, if you have violent criminals, if you have criminals who are using guns, who are using violence, who are dealing drugs to children, the criminal justice system should come down on them like a ton of bricks. But at the same time we need to recognize that young people make mistakes, and we should not live in a world of Le Miserables, where a young man finds his entire future taken away by excessive mandatory minimums. I want to commend Senator Lee, Senator Durbin, for their leadership on this. It’s not easy to bring together this broad bipartisan coalition, but it’s an issue that matters. It’s an issue of justice.

The Republican budget would throw 27 million Americans off of health insurance and make draconian cuts to education, nutrition, affordable housing and prescription drug coverage. Meanwhile, that same budget provides huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in the country.\n\n“The Republican budget moves us in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of creating jobs, it cuts jobs. Instead of making college more affordable, it cuts Pell Grants. Instead of helping to eliminate hunger in America, it will add to the financial problems of low-income Americans and create more hunger. This is Robin Hood in reverse. It takes from the poor and working families, and gives to the rich and large corporations,” said Bernie, who led the opposition to the Republican budget as ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nDuring the week-long debate, Republicans rejected proposals to put Americans back to work, raise the minimum wage, help students afford college, and protect seniors on Social Security and Medicare.\n \nBudget Facts: Read how the GOP budget would affect Vermonters:\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/the-gop-budget-is-a-disaster-for-vermont","2015-04-13 20:53:49+00","9124187907_10153216202382908",15],[26545,"Democracy for Sale: https://youtu.be/EkIHMCslwUo","2015-04-11 00:42:01+00","9124187907_10153208500947908",15],[26546,"","2015-04-10 17:11:01+00","9124187907_10153208108802908",15],[26549,"","2015-04-08 13:05:00+00","9124187907_10153202815497908",15],[26551,"","2015-04-07 21:05:01+00","9124187907_10153201453742908",15],[26552,"","2015-04-07 17:10:01+00","9124187907_10153201000472908",15],[26556,"","2015-04-05 16:00:00+00","9124187907_10153197550307908",15],[26557,"","2015-04-06 12:30:01+00","9124187907_10153197939577908",15],[26559,"","2015-04-02 14:14:20+00","9124187907_10153187449942908",15],[26562,"","2015-03-29 18:21:45+00","9124187907_10153177625502908",15],[26564,"","2015-03-27 19:01:36+00","9124187907_10153172509257908",15],[26566,"","2015-03-27 14:05:57+00","9124187907_10153171950632908",15],[26567,"","2015-03-27 00:35:00+00","9124187907_10153170830342908",15],[26569,"","2015-03-25 17:10:01+00","9124187907_10153167577392908",15],[26574,"","2015-03-23 21:25:01+00","9124187907_10153163038317908",15],[26576,"","2015-03-22 00:34:00+00","9124187907_10153158505277908",15],[26578,"","2015-03-21 13:15:01+00","9124187907_10153157192897908",15],[26581,"","2015-03-21 17:15:00+00","9124187907_10153157659997908",15],[26583,"#TBT","2015-03-19 13:05:01+00","9124187907_10153152132402908",15],[26584,"","2015-03-19 00:45:01+00","9124187907_10153151180932908",15],[26586,"","2015-03-17 21:45:01+00","9124187907_10153148663867908",15],[26587,"","2015-03-17 16:45:00+00","9124187907_10153148036597908",15],[26590,"","2015-03-16 21:45:00+00","9124187907_10153146359717908",15],[26592,"","2015-03-14 17:15:00+00","9124187907_10153140360072908",15],[26593,"Tomorrow: Choral Concert Featuring Vermont High School Choruses: \n\nSen.

Climate change.\n\nUnlike many leaders who name-drop Pope Francis to score political points—he is, after all, likely the most popular man on the planet—Sanders quotes the Pope because he actually believes his message. When asked about casino capitalism, Sanders points to Pope Francis, who says that is not what human life should be. “He’s saying, you know what…the economy should serve people, not people serving the economy,” Sanders explains. “The market is the billionaire class who want to get richer, that is what it is.

We have got to stay focused on those issues that impact the lives of tens of millions of Americans who struggle every day to keep their heads above water economically, and who worry deeply about the kind of future their kids will have.\n\nYes. We make no apologies in stating that the great moral, economic and political issue of our time is the growing level of income and wealth inequality in our nation. It is a disgrace to everything this country is supposed to stand for when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when one family (the Waltons) owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. No. The economy is not sustainable when the middle class continues to disappear and when 95 percent of all new income generated since the Wall Street crash goes to the top 1 percent. In order to create a vibrant economy, working families need disposable income. That is often not the case today. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/fight-for-our-progressive_b_6391234.html","2014-12-29 17:45:31+00","9124187907_10152932871612908",15],[26747,"","2014-12-27 17:45:01+00","9124187907_10152927401362908",15],[26750,"","2014-12-26 17:35:01+00","9124187907_10152924759662908",15],[26754,"","2014-12-23 13:35:00+00","9124187907_10152916208347908",15],[26755,"An Unsung Heroine:\n\n“Gretchen Bailey is an unsung heroine,” said Sen.

On Friday, Sanders said strong majorities of Americans also want action on other critical issues – from jobs to income and wealth inequality to raising the minimum wage – but Republicans in Congress have blocked progress. “Ordinary Americans understand that the economy today is not doing well for the middle class or working families,” Sanders said on his weekly radio and Internet program with Thom Hartmann. “People know that the middle class is disappearing. They know more people are living in poverty and that the wealthy and large corporations are doing phenomenally well.

Unemployment is much too high, wages and income are too low, millions of Americans are struggling to find affordable health care, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this inequality is the large and widening gap in life expectancy that exists around this country. Within a state or even within a single city, life expectancy can vary widely depending on the neighborhood. Every American is affected by these disparities. The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country in the world; however, Americans in nearly all age groups and in all social classes have shorter life expectancies than their counterparts in 16 other high-income countries (Institute of Medicine, 2013).\n\nRead more: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/life-in-mcdowell-county","2014-09-25 14:48:09+00","9124187907_10152699034427908",15],[26944,"","2014-09-24 22:35:00+00","9124187907_10152697423432908",15],[26945,"What Do the Koch Brothers Want?

In Rutland, for example, gas could be purchased last week for little more than $3.30 a gallon. Meanwhile, people filling up in St. Albans and Burlington were forced to pay about 30 cents more per gallon. The cost to fuel distributors to haul gas 75 miles adds about a nickel to the price of a gallon of gas, according to a pricing expert at the Oil Price Information Service. In other words, there is no economic justification for gas in northwestern Vermont to cost 30 cents more a gallon than in Rutland.\n\nRead more: \nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/high-gas-prices-a-possible-solution-from-kentucky?utm_source=vtbuzz\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_content=Headline+IMG+featured\u0026utm_campaign=Vermont+Bernie+Buzz+09-05\n","2014-09-08 22:05:00+00","9124187907_10152661916872908",15],[26999,"","2014-09-07 20:05:01+00","9124187907_10152659714152908",15],[27002,"Sanders Proposes Wealth Tax; Piketty, Reich Applaud: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/sanders-proposes-wealth-tax-piketty-reich-applaud","2014-09-06 16:00:01+00","9124187907_10152656894627908",15],[27003,"The Week in Review: \n\nThe broadest measure of unemployment in the United States was 12 percent in August, the Labor Department announced on Friday.

Sanders was saddened by Shinseki’s resignation, WCAX-TV reported. He called Shinseki a “true American hero” during interviews on MSNBC, CNN and The Thom Hartmann Program.\n\nWhat Now?: Senate Democrats plan to move their version of a House-passed bill giving the VA secretary greater authority to fire high-level employees. Sen. Sanders also plans to revive a broader veterans' benefits package that would allow the VA to open 27 new medical facilities around the country and provide incentives to lure more doctors and nurses into VA careers, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press reported. Shinseki urged Congress to support Sanders’ legislation, CBS News, Fox News, The Guardian, Politico, National Journal and Washington Examiner reported.\n\nRepublicans Roadblocks: President Obama and many Democratic lawmakers say an increase in veterans using VA hospitals calls for more doctors and nurses to prevent veterans from having to endure long wait times for care. But hiring them would require a big funding increase, something that is unlikely to happen given the strong resistance by Republicans. In February, Senate Republicans blocked a bill by Sen. Sanders to expand veterans' benefits. Just two Republican senators voted for the measure that would have cost about $21 billion over a decade, Reuters reported.\n\nContinue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/060114","2014-05-31 12:41:03+00","9124187907_10152419537832908",15],[27269,"The Week in Review: \n\nEric Shinseki resigned Friday as the Department of Veterans Affairs chief.

Bernie Sanders called the retired four-star general “an American hero.” He also pledged to work with new leadership at the VA to transform the culture and punish those responsible for manipulating records to conceal how long it really takes to see a doctor. New calls to abolish door-to-door mail service are part of a “fierce attack on the Postal Service,” Sanders said on Wednesday. A new report prepared for Sanders looked at when and why people enroll for Social Security retirement benefits.

Sen. Sanders told The Ed Show on MSNBC the Postal Service would “make about a billion dollars in profit” this year without the prefunding mandate. “If you want to save the Postal Service, you get rid of that burden, not prevent people from getting door-to-door delivery,” Sanders said. \n\nVA Health Care: The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general said veterans using a Phoenix VA hospital were inappropriately kept on unofficial waiting lists. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, called the inspector general's interim findings \"unacceptable\" but didn't join in calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to step down. He urged Shinseki to immediately implement the inspector general’s recommendations, The Washington Post and New York Daily News reported. \n\nNuclear Safety: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected calls from U.S. senators and watchdog groups to move spent nuclear fuel from storage pools into safer, sturdier dry casks, the Cape Cod Times reported.  The commission's vote prompted a response from Sens.

Bernard Sanders, the Senate veterans committee chairman, told The New York Times. He will offer legislation to let VA patients who can’t get appointments go to community health centers, military hospitals or private doctors. He also wants to provide medical school scholarships and loan forgiveness as incentives to attract more physicians and nurses to careers at the VA. \n\nVA Health Centers: Veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are overwhelming underfunded VA facilities in the Southwest and South, Sen. Sanders told The New York Times. VA has set a goal of seeing patients within 14 days. “Do we have the staffing to achieve that goal?” Sanders asked. “In some parts of the country, clearly we do not.” As part of the solution, Sanders’ bill also would fund construction of 27 new VA health facilities, The Hill reported. \n\nVermont Yankee: A decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week not to endorse the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from pools to dry cask storage won’t have an effect on the anticipated transfer of the highly radioactive fuel at Vermont Yankee. Vermont Department of Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia said Entergy Nuclear already committed to move Yankee’s 3,000 spent fuel rods into casks. The decision by the NRC was protested by Sen. Sand‍‍ers, who this month introduced legislation to require the removal of spent fuel to dry casks, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. \n\nSave Social Security: Sanders has advocated for years that the fairest approach to making Social Security fully solvent for the next 50 years is to lift the cap on taxable income, and apply the Social Security payroll tax on income above $250,000. “We’re inclined to agree with Sanders,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial on Friday. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/053014","2014-05-30 11:27:59+00","9124187907_10152417043052908",15],[27273,"Perspective:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders called it “unacceptable” that some veterans are forced to wait too long for care at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. And he said it was “totally intolerable” that some VA employees may be manipulating records to hide how long veterans really have to wait to see doctors. But he also offered some perspective on the situation as chairman of both the Senate veterans committee and a subcommittee on primary care. He has warned for years that the nation’s entire health care system is facing a crisis in primary care. Merritt Hawkins, a health care consulting firm, found this year that the average wait time to see a family physician in 15 markets studied was 19.5 days. That’s longer than the VA’s goal of 14 days. Sanders is the chief sponsor of legislation that the Senate debated in in February that would have expanded the department’s health system with 27 new facilities.\n\nRead more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/perspective","2014-05-29 18:04:24+00","9124187907_10152415593647908",15],[27275,"41 senators voted against #veterans benefits.

Sanders put Pfizer on a list of ‘Top Ten Corporate Tax Avoiders,’ claiming it paid no income taxes from 2010 to 2012 and that it received $2.2billion of tax refunds from the IRS at the same time as making $43 billion in worldwide profit, London’s Daily Mail reported. \n\nKeystone Pipeline Looms as Senate Takes up Energy Bill: The impassioned debate over the Keystone XL pipeline could reach a tipping point this week on Capitol Hill, with this likely the last chance for the issue to be considered legislatively until after the November midterm elections. The outcome could complicate matters for the Obama administration, which is still reviewing whether to allow permits for sections of the pipeline.

At a June 2013 hearing, Sen.

Federal Election Commission decision earlier this month. Stevens recently told The New Yorker that McCutcheon was “grossly incorrect” and he has been consistently critical of the shifting campaign finance landscape since the landmark Citizens United decision boosted the First Amendment rights of corporations.

This is largely due to the fact that investment income – which makes up a large portion of the super-rich's earnings – is taxed at a lower rate than income. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/041914","2014-04-19 13:06:34+00","9124187907_10152325056077908",15],[27403,"Today's news from Sen.

Sanders “keen and brilliant insights” into the Koch brothers' extremist agenda were laid out in an op-ed by the senator for The Huffington Post, according to a Daily Kos blog. The Kochs’ objective “is to move this country from a democratic society with a strong middle class to an oligarchic form of society in which the economic and political life of the nation are controlled by a handful of billionaire families,” Sanders wrote in the column that also was posted at MichaelMoore.com, Green Mountain Daily, Op-Ed News and Daily Kos.\n\nU.S. and Russia Agree on Pact to Defuse Ukraine Crisis: The United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union reached an agreement on Thursday evening that calls for armed pro-Russian bands to give up the government buildings they have seized in eastern Ukraine and outlines other steps to de-escalate the crisis, The New York Times reported.

David Koch was the candidate for vice president that year on a ticket headed by Edward Clark. They thought Ronald Reagan was too liberal. Back then, they got 1 percent of the vote. Today, David Koch and his brother Charles have turned those 1980 extremist ideas into mainstream Republican Party orthodoxy by putting their fortune behind right-wing politicians and think tanks. It’s all part of a campaign, Sen.

What we also know economically is that when you put money in the hands of people who are going to spend it, it creates jobs,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. “So this is a twofer.”  \n\nSanders: Court Decision ‘Dead Wrong’: The Supreme Court removed the cap on the total amount of money donors can contribute to candidates and parties in each election. \"They are dead wrong,\" Sen. Sanders said in an interview broadcast Friday on Vermont Public Radio. “The court decision “is freedom for a handful of the wealthiest people in this country to undermine American democracy and to buy elections,” lamented Sanders in Sunday editions of The New York Times.

That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially,” Sanders said. Passing the bill is “the morally right thing to do” and “good economics,” the senator added, but he cautioned that the measure faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-run House.\n\nThis bill to extend long-term emergency unemployment benefits for 2.2 million Americans would restore benefits that expired nearly three months ago.The benefits, about $300 a week on average, help jobless workers fill up their gas tank to get to a job interview, feed their families, pay the rent and heat their homes.\n\nEach  week that the Congress fails to act, an additional 72,000 Americans are losing their unemployment benefits. Today, about 4 million Americans who are currently looking for a job have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In the wake of a slow recovery from the recession that began in 2007, long-term unemployment is near a 60-year high.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans today oppose extending the benefits, but when George W. Bush was President, Republicans, including Boehner, voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times  Now that Barack Obama is in the White House, many congressional Republicans oppose extending these benefits. Since 1958, Congress has never failed to pass emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment has been as high as it is today. Today, there are nearly three job applicants for every one job opening.  There simply aren’t enough jobs out there for the more than 10 million Americans who are actively seeking work.\n\nThe long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it’s been at any other time Congress has let emergency jobless assistance expire. For example, hundreds of people applied last month to work at a Sam’s Club in Oxford, Ala., that won’t be opening until August. In January, more than 5,000 people waited in line for just 1,500 jobs at an outlet mall in Palm Beach, Fla. That same month, 1,600 people in Hagerstown, Md., applied for just 36 job openings at a dairy farm to process milk and ice cream. Last December, 10,000 people applied for just 750 flight attendant jobs at Southwest Airlines and more than 23,000 Americans applied for just 600 jobs at Wal-Mart in Washington, DC.\n\nIf Congress fails to extend emergency unemployment benefits, 240,000 American workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year. The overall economy will be hurt because when people lose their unemployment benefits, they don’t go to the grocery store, they don’t buy clothes, they don’t go to the pharmacy.  Businesses lose customers, they lose money, and they fire even more people.","2014-04-04 16:30:01+00","9124187907_10152291475452908",15],[27444,"Today's news from Sen.

Plutocracy has been used in English since the middle of the 17th century to refer to the rule or power of the wealthy. Pluto comes from the Greek for \"wealth.\" Back in 1917, Theodore Roosevelt said government by a plutocracy is un-American. It took Sen.

Whether it is the BDS movement on college campuses, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, or radical Islamic terror in Israel and around the world, we need modern-day Maccabees to stand together and push back against the forces of evil. As a nation founded by a people seeking religious liberty, America stands with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in protecting the light of faith and liberty.\n\nThe victory of the people of Israel is a testament to God’s providence. On these nights when Jewish families around the country and the world celebrate with latkes, lighting the menorah, and playing dreidel, Heidi and I join with you to recognize, ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Sham,’ a great miracle happened there. We only need look at our nation’s heritage to know that great miracles have happened here too, ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Po,’ and will continue to happen with God’s blessing. We are grateful for the Divine tradition and we give thanks for the blessings of liberty. \n\nHeidi and I wish the Jewish Community a very #HappyChanukah.","2015-12-07 19:36:30+00","315496455229328_825178907594411",14],[22747,"The #WashingtonCartel strikes back.\n\nThe #ExImBank is an egregious example of corporate welfare and has no business being reauthorized -- period, much less snuck through as part of an alleged must-pass bill.","2015-12-04 18:55:54+00","315496455229328_824016311044004",14],[22748,"Since before my first day in office, I pledged to do everything within my power to repeal #Obamacare.

It is not enough to simply object to this resolution while leaving the door open to future iterations.  The United States should declare our unambiguous opposition to any and all attempts to exploit the U.N. to unilaterally gain recognition of Palestinian statehood.  We should make clear that continuing these efforts will result in the immediate freeze in American financial support to the P.A.

Rather than threatening the Israelis with penalties if they do not offer the Palestinians intolerable security concessions, we should redouble our efforts to ensure that security through mutual investment in programs ranging from missile defense to natural gas exploration.\n\nSuch actions might not be popular at the U.N. or in Tehran, but they would provide a much-needed clarity to a monumental challenge—and through that clarity might actually help provide a real path to peace.

Yet the road to freedom for African Americans in this country has been too long. For years, civil rights leaders fought for their rights, and for justice, but they faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge in the Senate: a bloc of Southern Democrats who refused to support the bill.\n\nToday we remember the long and contentious debate that lasted sixty days, before Senate Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey (MN) and Republican Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen (IL) were together able to compile the votes needed to end the filibuster, pass the bill, and make it law. We remember the words of Senator Dirksen when he rose that day when the filibuster ended, urging his colleagues to drop their opposition to the bill. He recalled, ‘It is said that on the night he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, substantially this sentiment: Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come. The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing of government, in education, and in employment. It must not be stayed or denied.’\n\nNonetheless, 23 Democrats and 6 Republicans fiercely opposed ending the filibuster and taking up the landmark bill.  And yet, the remainder of the Senate – Republicans and Democrats joining together – invoked cloture and passed the bill, to ensure that all people, regardless of race, gender, or religion were treated with equality and dignity under the law. Republicans and Democrats gathered at the White House on July 2 to watch President Johnson, a Southerner from Texas, sign the bill into law, finally making good on the words of President John F. Kennedy who a year earlier called on every American to “examine his conscience” and support the bill.\n\nOur work is not over. Racial discrimination and bigotry persists, and we must be united working to defeat it. Moreover, when Dr. Martin Luther King gathered millions on the National Mall in the summer of 1963, those men and women were marching for not only their rights, but also for opportunity.\n\nWe can still do better by fighting to give everyone in our country the opportunities they deserve.  We must do better. And, if Republicans and Democrats can come together as they did in 1964 once again, we will.","2014-07-02 15:12:59+00","315496455229328_571930352919269",14],[23335,"When President Obama’s own Supreme Court nominees join their colleagues in unanimously rejecting his Administration’s call for broader federal power twenty times since Obama took office, the inescapable conclusion is that the Obama Administration’s view of federal power knows virtually no bounds.","2014-07-01 18:13:10+00","315496455229328_571416002970704",14],[23337,"The #HobbyLobby victory is great news, but Obamacare's assault on religious liberty continues.

Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Ed Shultz Radio Show that he hopes regulators will adjust the overtime threshold to raise wages for those making less than $1,000 per week. Sanders said the move marks a shift in focus to “the most pressing problem” the nation faces – high levels of income and wealth inequality. \n \nSenate Passes Child Care Bill: The Senate passed legislation Thursday to renew programs providing health care and food assistance to children. “More than 1 in 5 children in America live in households that lack consistent access to adequate food because their parents don’t make enough money,” Sen.

At a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Sanders, Dr. Danielle Martin, a physician and health policy professor from Toronto, sparred with Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican anti-Obamacare senator, about Canada's health care system. “She more than held her own,” Sanders told the Toronto Sun. Martin was called “Canada’s newest hero” in The Huffington Post. Her testimony also was featured in reports for Yahoo News Canada, Daily Kos and Wonkette.\n \nHealth Care: In what Canada’s CBC News called “some political theatre,” Sen. Sanders “playfully” asked Dr. Martin if Canada’s current prime minister is a socialist. “No sir, our prime minister is quite conservative,” Dr. Martin said. “So obviously, as a conservative he wants to implement the American health-care system. I gather that is the first thing he did when he took power, is that right?” Sanders asked. “Not exactly,” the Toronto physician replied. “Support for single-payer Medicare in Canada goes across all political stripes.”\n\nContinue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031414a","2014-03-14 13:35:02+00","9124187907_10152091963087893",15],[27511,"Working Overtime:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday called for new overtime rules so more workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half pay after putting in a 40-hour workweek. Obama’s directive to the Labor Department eventually will help millions of low-wage workers. Now, a worker on  salary of more than $455 a week with minimal management duties may be denied overtime.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders applauded the president’s action. “It is absurd that millions of workers making as little as $455 a week are considered ‘supervisors’ and get no overtime pay.  I hope the Department of Labor raises that threshold to at least $1,000, which would reflect inflation since 1975. That step alone would mean a raise for millions of workers. More money in the hands of working people would mean that those workers could then go out and make purchases that would help create more jobs.”\n\nIt will take a while before workers see any more money in their paychecks. Leaving the details to be worked out by the Labor Department, Obama did not specify what the new salary thresholds should be.

Under the law, the Labor Department was given the authority to change the salary thresholds to account for inflation.

And you pay for this service at a cost far less than anywhere else in the industrialized world.\n\nYet the Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service. They see an opportunity for Wall Street and corporate America to make billions in profits out of these services, and couldn't care less how privatization or a degradation of services affects ordinary Americans.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/theres-no-need-to-end-saturday-mail-delivery","2014-03-05 16:57:49+00","9124187907_10152228933662908",15],[27537,"Today's news from Sen.

The budget also contains significant tax increases on the wealthy, tax cuts for the working class and $56 billion in increased spending above the 2015 budget cap. “At a time when the wealthiest Americans are doing phenomenally well, [the budget] asks some of the richest people in the country to start paying their fair share of taxes,” said Sen.

Instead, the president will demand what the country needs the most: new investments in education, in energy efficiency, in job training.

The Social Security cut, known as a “chained” Consumer Price Index, was never a good idea. It was likely to hurt vulnerable retirees, but had been long advocated by the right. Nonetheless, Republicans refused to consider that change if it meant touching the tax breaks of their wealthiest donors, so they passed up a chance to achieve their stated goal of reducing entitlement spending.\n\n“Over the course of last year, Republicans consistently showed a lack of willingness to negotiate on a deficit-reduction deal,” a White House official said, “refusing to identify even one unfair tax loophole they would be willing to close, despite the president’s willingness to put tough things on the table.”\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/opinion/an-end-to-the-grand-bargain-charades.html?_r=1","2014-02-23 23:05:04+00","9124187907_10101522562444509",15],[27574,"Today's news from Sen.

And as sports fans around the world focused on the Winter Olympics, Sanders placed a statement in Friday’s Congressional Record praising a big delegation of Vermont athletes representing the United States in Sochi, Russia.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-020714\n","2014-02-07 23:00:01+00","9124187907_10101493985497939",15],[27611,"The End of Snow? - Porter Fox, The New York Times:\n\nOVER the next two weeks, hundreds of millions of people will watch Americans like Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin ski for gold on the downhill alpine course. Television crews will pan across epic vistas of the rugged Caucasus Mountains, draped with brilliant white ski slopes. What viewers might not see is the 16 million cubic feet of snow that was stored under insulated blankets last year to make sure those slopes remained white, or the hundreds of snow-making guns that have been running around the clock to keep them that way.\n\nOfficials canceled two Olympic test events last February in Sochi after several days of temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a lack of snowfall had left ski trails bare and brown in spots. That situation led the climatologist Daniel Scott, a professor of global change and tourism at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, to analyze potential venues for future Winter Games. His thought was that with a rise in the average global temperature of more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit possible by 2100, there might not be that many snowy regions left in which to hold the Games. He concluded that of the 19 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics, as few as 10 might be cold enough by midcentury to host them again. By 2100, that number shrinks to 6.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/the-end-of-snow","2014-02-10 00:00:01+00","9124187907_10101497119192989",15],[27613,"Today's news from Sen.

The move marks a significant victory for labor unions and a handful of progressive Democrats who pressed the president to issue the order, including Reps. Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva and Sen. Bernie Sanders. The new policy, to be instituted via executive order, may affect hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are supported by federal dollars. Fifteen senators, led by Sanders, sent a letter to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority to raise the minimum wage, Politico reported.\n\nMinimum Wage: An analysis by the Employment Policies Institute found that 96 percent of House and Senate sponsors of the minimum wage bill do not pay their interns, according to FoxNews.com. Sen. Sanders is the only sponsor who pays all of his interns, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nIncome Inequality: Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Monday that providing a quality education to every American should be a top priority to reduce poverty. “We should learn from many other countries that understand that education is an investment, and that every kid in this country regardless of income should have educational opportunity.” At one point, Sanders accused Bachmann of wanting to cut Social Security. “That’s absolutely a lie,” Bachmann responded, not mentioning that in 2010 she called the program “a tremendous fraud” in 2010 and supported Rep. Paul Ryan’s program in 2011 that called for doing just that, The Raw Story reported.\n\nSanders Signs Supreme Court Brief in Birth Control Case: In a brief to be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, 18 Democratic senators and an independent, Sanders, side with the Obama administration against evangelical Christian businessmen who argue that paying for their employees’ birth control, a requirement under Obamacare, violates their company’s religious freedom. The senators—five of them women—argue in their “friend of the court” brief that the owners of the Oklahoma-based crafts store chain Hobby Lobby are not exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate simply because some forms of birth control offend their religious beliefs, Yahoo News reported.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/012814","2014-01-28 13:58:34+00","9124187907_10152005336097893",15],[27647,"Verizon v.

Fifteen senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and 17 members of the House, led by Keith Ellison of Minnesota, sent letters to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority.

In a major speech outlining his agenda to reform NSA surveillance, Obama last week pressed for a plan to move the phone records out of the government’s control. But, unlike the watchdog group, he did not call for an end to the program. “The president's recommendations last week did not go far enough to rein in the out-of-control National Security Agency,” Sen. Sanders said in the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.

Sanders said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. “It is a moral issue, and once we begin to look at those issues from a moral perspective, it demands political solutions.” \n\nMinimum Wage: President Barack Obama told his Cabinet this month he would not resign himself to \"waiting for legislation\" from a gridlocked Congress in order to push his agenda, The president could move the ball forward by announcing a few dramatic actions at his State of the Union address this month. Sen. Sanders and other progressive leaders have urged the president to issue an executive order that would ensure that taxpayer dollars go only to federal contractors that pay their employees a living wage, Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote for The Washington Post online. \n\nFood Banks Prepare for Food Stamp Cuts: Even greater demands on food banks are expected as Congress prepares to cut billions of dollars more from the food stamp program. About 47 million Americans receive food stamps. A compromise farm bill is expected to cut about $9 billion from food stamps over 10 years. House Republicans had wanted to trim financing by $40 billion over the same period, and a bipartisan Senate bill sought a $4 billion cut. But House members, most of them Republicans, may be unwilling to pass a bill that includes anything less than the $40 billion cut. And senators, especially Democrats, may see the compromise measure as going too far. President Obama has threatened to veto any bill that cuts too deeply, The New York Times reported. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/012214","2014-01-22 14:28:15+00","9124187907_10101465459838589",15],[27658,"Today's news from Sen.

The Senate Climate Action Task Force questioned why the issue hasn’t gotten more attention on Sunday morning news programs. Sanders pointed to a study by the media watchdog group Media Matters for America, which found that during 2012 the news shows devoted a total of 8 minutes to climate change, according to an Associated Press report in the Rutland Herald and on WPTZ-TV on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nNSA Spying: “The president really faces some challenges in Congress. He's not only up against opposition in his own party, from Bernie Sanders, but Rand Paul and others in the Republican Party. They're almost forming a new coalition that's really going to push back I think against the president's recommendations,” Robert Costa of The Washington Post said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nMLK Day: Sen. Sanders spoke at an event marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Burlington, Vt. “King had incredible courage. He led the fight [against] segregation but also said that every child in this country, every person in this country was entitled to health care, to education, to jobs, to decent wages. Let's never forget,” Sanders said in a report broadcast Monday on WCAX-TV. \n\nBad Trade Deal: The Trans Pacific Partnership — a new secret international trade agreement — will dramatically expand the rights of international corporations over those of … consumers, workers, and the environment.

Many of us want to make sure that we protect the American people without undermining the constitutional rights that make us a free people,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Saturday on MSNBC. The Associated Press reported that Sanders remains convinced that the collection of data on every phone call made in the United States violates constitutional privacy protections. \n\nA Chilling Impact: Sen. Sanders said he’s concerned about the impact of what the NSA is doing on American citizens. “And I think all of this stuff has a very significant chilling impact on the willingness of the American people to be thinking about issues, to be writing about issues, to be talking about issues,” Sanders said on KQED-FM in San Francisco, WAMU-FM in Washington D.C., and other NPR affiliates on Weekend Edition. \n\nLeft Right Coalition: What distinguishes the surveillance issue from so many that have stymied a polarized Congress is that it does not follow easy patterns. The libertarian right, represented by Sen. Rand. Paul, has joined the liberal left, represented by lawmakers like Sen. Sanders. “Ideology is sort of confusing on this one. When you have Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders on the same side, that makes for a pretty interesting debate,” Sen. Angus King told The New York Times in an article also published on Sunday in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. \n\nSingle Payer Health Care: Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation which would require that each state set up a single-payer insurance system. One upside would be simplicity, said Laura Martin of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. Some doctors spend as much as a third of their overhead dealing with insurance documents.

Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch faulted Obama for not going far enough with his reforms. Sen. Patrick Leahy said Obama ordered some “significant changes,” but that more are needed from Congress.  Sanders said he is bringing civil liberties experts to a town meeting Feb. 11. at Vermont’s capital to discuss the issue of domestic surveillance, the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported. \n\nWhat If Nixon Had the NSA?: Sanders on Friday raised the possibility of what the bulk data storage means for a future \"unscrupulous president\" or \"rogue operator\" at the NSA. \"I want people to think, if Nixon had the resources and the technology that now exists.

I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.\n\nEight years earlier, I’d walked onto the trading floor at Credit Suisse First Boston to begin my summer internship. I already knew I wanted to be rich, but when I started out I had a different idea about what wealth meant. I’d come to Wall Street after reading in the book “Liar’s Poker” how Michael Lewis earned a $225,000 bonus after just two years of work on a trading floor. That seemed like a fortune. Every January and February, I think about that time, because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed, when fortunes are made.\n\nI’d learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman, a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. “Imagine what life will be like,” he’d say, “when I make a million dollars.” While he dreamed of selling a screenplay, in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom’s nurse-practitioner salary.\n\nDad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22, so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs, high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials, knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It looked as if the traders were playing a video game inside a spaceship; if you won this video game, you became what I most wanted to be — rich.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/opinion/sunday/for-the-love-of-money.html?_r=0","2014-01-21 01:30:01+00","9124187907_10101462951195929",15],[27674,"Today's news from Sen.

The Labor Department announced on Friday that the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008, but The Associated Press noted that the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs.

Democrats offered a roughly $18 billion proposal that would extend the benefits through most of 2014, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid scheduled a showdown vote Monday. Democrats need at least five GOP senators to cross the aisle and support the plan, but they appear to lack the support of several of the key six Republicans who previously supported advancing the bill and have now said they are very likely to vote against the new proposal.

Of the 365 federal solar applications since 2009, just 20 plants are on track to be built. Only three large-scale solar facilities have gone online, two in California and one in Nevada. The first auction of public land for solar developers, an event once highly anticipated by federal planners, failed to draw a single bid last fall, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/011214","2014-01-12 13:38:27+00","9124187907_10151976569072893",15],[27685,"Unemployment Insurance:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/1HOBw5d8i6Y","2014-01-11 16:15:29+00","9124187907_10151975075477893",15],[27686,"Today's news from Sen.

At a time when the problems facing us are monumental, Congress is dysfunctional and more and more people (especially the young) are, understandably, giving up on the political process. The people are hurting. They look to Washington for help. Nothing is happening.\n\nIn my view, the main cause of congressional dysfunction is an extreme right-wing Republican party whose main goal is to protect the wealthy and powerful. There is no tax break for the rich or large corporations that they don't like. There is no program which protects working families -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, affordable housing, etc. -- that they don't want to cut.\n\nBut the Democrats (with whom I caucus as an Independent) are most certainly not without fault. In the Senate, they have tolerated Republican obstructionism for much too long and allowed major legislation to fail for lack of 60 votes. They have failed to bring forth a strong and consistent agenda which addresses the economic crises facing the vast majority of our struggling population, and have not rallied the people in support of that agenda.\n\nAs we survey our country at the end of 2013, I don't have to tell you about the crises we face. Many of you are experiencing them every day.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/2014-seize-the-moment_b_4518335.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\u0026ir=Politics","2013-12-31 20:06:57+00","9124187907_10152089315002908",15],[27708,"Today's news from Sen.

Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday that. “Most people understand that is a starvation wage. Individuals can't live on it, families can't live on it,” Sanders said. He is a cosponsor of a bill that would raise the wage. \n\nUnemployment: If Congress fails to extend long-term unemployment benefits that expired on Saturday for 1.3 million Americans, another 5 million people looking for work will lose benefits this year. “You are cutting off your nose to spite your face by denying people who need the help the help they should be getting,” Sen. Sanders said on WCAX-TV on Monday. He explained why on The Ed Schultz Show. “What the economists tell us is that if we shut off extended unemployment benefits, we are going to lose about 200,000 jobs, because these folks will not be spending money and the GDP for next year will go down by about two-tenths of 1 percent.”\n\nNSA Spying: Vermont lawmakers support legislation to rein in massive National Security Agency surveillance programs, Vermont Public Radio reported. “If they have probable cause that somebody is involved in terrorism, go after them and do all the investigating you have to do tap all the phones you have to tap,” said Sen.

Sen. Sanders said the new system will be a relief to businesses, which will see an increased tax burden but won’t have to spend vast sums on employees’ insurance and administer the benefits. He hopes the plan will become an example for other states. “Americans want to see a model that works,” the senator said. “If Vermont can be that model it will have a profound impact on discourse in this country.” \n\nIBM Workers: The Vermont Department of Labor has gotten federal help for some, but not all, of the workers let go last summer by IBM in Essex Junction and Williston. “I appreciate that the U.S. Department of Labor ruled on behalf of IBM’s Williston workers. I am dismayed, however, they have not yet ruled in favor of those Vermonters who worked on the Essex Junction cam pus,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said.

Bernie Sanders said Congress must narrow the scope of a law used to justify the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records. “I voted against the Patriot Act. We've introduced legislation to curb what the NSA is doing,” Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts.

It’s very much the lesser of two evils,” Sen. Sanders, according to Real Clear Politics.  Sanders was an unenthusiastic supporter, according to CNN. \"This budget does not even begin to address some of the very serious problems facing our country in terms of creating the millions of jobs we need, in terms of doing away with these outrageous corporate loopholes right now which are costing us about $100 billion a year,\" Sanders told  Nicole Sandler on The Randi Rhodes Show.  \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/121813","2013-12-18 14:07:58+00","9124187907_10152058642612908",15],[27741,"Sen.

Sanders told The Wall Street Journal as he left a briefing on the budget deal.

The six-month period will give diplomats time to negotiate a more sweeping agreement, The Associated Press reported.\n\nFilibuster Reform: “The move by Senate Democrats to limit filibusters on presidential appointments is only a first step in ending a procedural abuse that unfairly tips the balance of power toward the minority … The solution is to restore the filibuster to its full glory. In December 2010, Sen. Sanders spoke for 8½ hours against President Obama’s tax cut deal, now known as “filibernie” … Sanders at least gave Americans a glimpse of what a true filibuster might look like. If a senator wants to block legislation and his side lacks the votes to defeat the bill, then let him or her stand up and speak for as long as he or she is physically able,” the Burlington Free Press said in an editorial.\n\nBudget Conference: Members of the House-Senate budget conference committee are narrowing the focus of their negotiations to a plan that would provide some sequester relief and new discretionary spending levels for appropriators for two years, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Although top aides caution that Democrats and Republicans do not have a deal yet, the spending targets and the provisions under discussion suggest leaders of the conference committee have set their sights on an outline for a limited agreement that would create budgeting stability through 2015 while setting aside larger and more contentious questions, Congressional Quarterlyreported.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/112413","2013-11-24 13:25:32+00","9124187907_10152002369407908",15],[27801,"One ‘Entitlement’ Really Does Need Trimming - Sam Pizzigati, Common Dreams: \n\nDeck the halls, this holiday season, with scenes of hunger.A new report neatly exposes the monumental hypocrisy of America’s most politically active corporate leaders.\n\nStruggling families all across America now have less food on their tables.

Bernie Sanders, the committee chairman, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday with the Vermont Press Bureau. A separate Sanders bill approved by the committee would expand veterans’ access to dental care. \n\nVA Shutdown Protection: The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee moved Tuesday to protect all veterans programs from a future government shutdown. The measure enjoys wide support from veterans’ groups but the Obama administration and a few members of Congress are not on board. The committee approved the bill on a 13-1 vote. Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican, was the lone opponent.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein last March introduced legislation to let the Department of Health and Human Services block “excessive” rate increases. Support for the bill could swell if lawmakers think industry executives have not done enough to keep premiums in check during the transition to the new government-backed insurance exchanges. So far, Feinstein’s bill has five cosponsors, including Sen. Sanders. \n\nA Progressive Budget Blueprint: Republican lawmakers want to balance the federal budget on the backs of poor and middle class Americans, but Sen. Sanders has a better idea. Sanders introduced a 10-point progressive budget blueprint that outlines fair ways to raise revenue, reduce spending, and create jobs. The plan calls for closing offshore tax havens, establishing a financial transaction tax on Wall Street, ending tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, increasing the capital gains tax, repealing the remaining Bush tax cuts, and more,” Jim Javinsky reported at Truthout and on The Thom Hartmann Program. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/111713","2013-11-17 14:26:05+00","9124187907_10151985241117908",15],[27829,"The Week in Review:\n\nThousands of you have taken up Sen.

Sanders has vowed to stop efforts to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. Budget negotiators said on Wednesday that they were still far from an agreement and put off scheduling any other public meetings as talks to ease automatic spending cuts moved behind closed doors. “I'm not a great fan of background negotiations,” Sanders said. \n\nCarbon Tax Would Lower Deficit, CBO Says: The Congressional Budget Office is out with new data showing that imposing a carbon tax would dramatically reduce the deficit, The Hill reported. The CBO report, issued Wednesday, lists options to cut the U.S. deficit along with their cost savings, according to National Journal. Both publications noted that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer floated a bill with Sen. Sanders. Their Climate Protection Act would impose a $20 dollar-per-ton tax. It would devote some of the revenue for deficit reduction but would return three-fifths of the revenue to U.S. residents. \n\nThe Fed: The Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing today on the nomination of Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve. “The Fed is an enormously powerful … secretive agency and the more light we can shed on it would be a good thing for the American people,\" Sen. Sanders told the Los Angeles Times. A Sanders provision in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law called for an audit of actions taken by the Fed during the 2008 financial crisis. Sanders supports expanded Fed audits but he disagrees with Sen.

Malia Talakai, a negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, a group that includes her tiny South Pacific homeland, Nauru, said that without urgent action to stem rising sea levels, “some of our members won’t be around.”\n\nFrom the time a scientific consensus emerged that human activity was changing the climate, it has been understood that the nations that contributed least to the problem would be hurt the most. Now, even as the possible consequences of climate change have surged — from the typhoons that have raked the Philippines and India this year to the droughts in Africa, to rising sea levels that threaten to submerge entire island nations — no consensus has emerged over how to rectify what many call “climate injustice.”\n\nGrowing demands to address the issue have become an emotionally charged flash point at negotiations here at the 19th conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which continues this week.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/world/growing-clamor-about-inequities-of-climate-crisis.html?hpw\u0026rref=world\u0026_r=0","2013-11-18 12:30:01+00","9124187907_10151986576027908",15],[27824,"Bernie On The Budget: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq-xjwgol4Q\u0026feature=share\u0026list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA\nRead Sen.

Bernie Sanders said on Friday that it is essential to have someone in the 2016 presidential campaign willing to take on Wall Street, address the collapse of the middle class, tackle the spread of poverty and fiercely oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Addressing global warming also needs to be a top priority, not an afterthought, Sanders said. In an interview with the Burlington Free Press, Sanders said he is willing to consider a run, probably as an independent, if no other progressive candidate steps up.\n\nUSPS Profits: The U.S. Postal Service achieved its first revenue increase in five years but still lost $5 billion in fiscal 2013, according to figures released Friday. Postal unions, the USPS board of governors, and at least one lawmaker said the overall loss was due to a requirement that the agency pre-fund retiree benefits to the tune of about $5.6 billion per year. Sen. Sanders, who has proposed legislation to end the pre-funding obligation, told The Washington Post that the Postal Service would have recorded a net profit of $600 million without the annual payment, which the agency has defaulted on for the past several years.

The middle class is disappearing. Poverty is at an all-time high. We're not even beginning to address the international crisis of global warming or our crumbling infrastructure or extremely high unemployment,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts in an interview earlier Wednesday on MSNBC. \n\nThe Next Fight: With the government re-opening and default averted, larger budget battles over entitlements and sequestration lie ahead. “When you have the Koch brothers, who sit on $71 billion, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process, trust me this battle has not ended,” Sen.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said leaders had made \"tremendous progress\" toward a deal and that he was hopeful Tuesday would be a \"bright day.\" The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seconded Mr. Reid's optimism.

The chained CPI also would lower benefits for disabled veterans and federal retirees. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/an-attack-on-seniors-and-veterans","2013-10-14 22:10:00+00","9124187907_10151899945317908",15],[27956,"Be heard by taking the latest poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling","2013-10-14 19:30:53+00","9124187907_10151899747317908",15],[27959,"Take the latest poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling","2013-10-14 01:36:10+00","9124187907_10151898270327908",15],[27960,"Day 13: \n\nWith a partial government shutdown stretching into its 13th day and the looming potential for a historic default on government debts just days away, Senate leaders talked on Sunday but did not settle an impasse over a stopgap measure to reopen the government. The stalemate began Oct. 1 over House Republican demands to gut the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work, the House shifted course last week and tried to use the shutdown as an excuse to cut Social Security. (The Associated Press reported on Sunday that next year’s cost-of-living adjustment, even with no change in the law, will probably be only  1.5 percent, one of the lowest ever. It’s not certain because the workers who crunch the inflation numbers have been furloughed.) The budget negotiations on Sunday reportedly focused on  how long the government should be funded and for how long.  The Senate also took steps to reconsider a vote on Saturday when Republicans, voting in lockstep, blocked consideration of a resolution to let the government continue to pay its bills.  Sen. Bernie Sanders worried that a default would spike interest rates on home mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards, but he said on Saturday that he believes  Wall Street and big-money interests would not let “the crazies” force the country into a default that could send the economy into a tailspin.\n\nRead the AP report on Social Security COLAs: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/social-security-raise-to-be-among-lowest-in-years\n\nTake the poll on cutting the safety net: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling","2013-10-13 23:18:57+00","9124187907_10151898088332908",15],[27961,"What the American People Want: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V79E8_Si-c\u0026feature=share\u0026list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA","2013-10-13 19:50:00+00","9124187907_10151895616342908",15],[27962,"Take the latest poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling","2013-10-13 14:50:01+00","9124187907_10151897071202908",15],[27963,"Today's news from Sen.

Sanders asked McDonald why he wants the job. “I think I can make a difference,\" the West Point graduate said in The Wall Street Journal. Sanders suggested jokingly that senators didn't want to say anything to scare McDonald into running out of the hearing room, The Washington Post reported. Sanders said he was impressed by McDonald's military and business backgrounds, the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Times and UPI reported. McDonald is well aware of the department’s problems, Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. McDonald said he would take action on reforms during his first 90 days in office, National Journal reported. \n\nVA Reform: Sen. Sanders said lawmakers tasked with creating bipartisan legislation to overhaul the VA have agreed to offset parts of the eventual bill with spending cuts, The Hill  reported.

Sanders is hosting a forum today in Washington to highlight the impact that defunding the Affordable Care Act would have on millions of uninsured Americans. Sanders cites recent studies saying up to 45,000 people die each year because they do not have health insurance and don't have access to the care they need,” WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.\n\nDebt Ceiling: “What’s happening is Wall Street and the big business community, the people who have huge influence over the GOP, are saying to Republicans that if you go forward and for the first time in the history of this country do not pay our debts, the United States economy — maybe the world economy — will be driven into dire straits,” Sanders said in a telephone interview Wednesday with the Vermont Press Bureau. He said he believes mainstream Republicans will seize control and prevent a default. But he remains concerned, he told Salon. “I am worried … [Y]ou really have people who live in another, in an ideological world which is very far removed from where I think most Americans are. And they believe so strongly, they hate Obama so much, and they believe so strongly in their views that if it means driving this country or the world into a recession or a depression, that from their point of view is a small price to pay to continue their efforts.” \n\nFilibuster: Sen. Sanders favors a growing movement among Senate Democrats to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling for one year by changing Senate rules to prevent a filibuster. Such a move would allow the Democrats, with a 54-seat majority, to pass the bill with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. “This idea, which seemed far-fetched months ago, is gaining more support right now,” Sanders said. “I can tell you, without naming names, that the very highest level of the Democratic leadership are starting to support this,” Sanders told Vermont Press Bureau. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/101013","2013-10-10 13:19:36+00","9124187907_10151890201887908",15],[27978,"Remember Rep.

That would be a death sentence for thousands of Americans without health insurance, Sen. Bernie Sanders told a Senate hearing on Thursday. As the week wore on, Republicans shifted their rationale for closing the government and defaulting on the country’s debts.  Now they demand deep cuts in Social Security and other programs.

Sen. Sanders, who supports limits for campaign contributions, attended the argument in the court's latest major campaign finance case, according to The Associated Press and Congressional Quarterly. “If we do not want to move this nation to a form of society where a handful of billionaires can determine the outcome of these elections, then it is imperative not only we overturn Citizens United, but we put a lid on how much people can contribute in elections,” Sanders said in a speech outside the court that aired on C-SPAN and excerpted on Democracy Now.

A copy of his testimony was obtained by The Washington Post. Shinseki will testify that if the shutdown continues into late October, compensation payments to more than 3.8 million veterans will not be made in November. “These include thousands of veterans who have the most severe disabilities,” he said in his advance testimony.

That was a “major concession,” Sanders said, but House Republicans keep adding new demands.\n\nSecond, the senator doubted House Speaker John Boehner’s claim that the Senate-passed spending resolution wouldn’t pass the House. In fact, some 20 House Republicans have signaled that they would support a so-called clean resolution and vote with House Democrats to reopen the government “Bring it to a vote, let's find out what's happening,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.\n\nThird, the shutdown strategy was planned and paid for by the Koch brothers and other wealthy individuals who want to defund the Affordable Care Act, cut Social Security benefits, end Medicare as we know it, abolish the minimum wage and cut other programs that help working families. Their attitude, Sanders said, is “to use every ounce of leverage, even if it means catastrophic pain for America and the world, so long as we get our way.” He cited a Sunday New York Times expose that detailed how the Koch brothers and others plotted the shutdown “from the day after Obama was re-elected.”\n\nThe Koch Brothers: http://youtu.be/fNj8bpY2PEY","2013-10-08 00:27:37+00","9124187907_10101260158743629",15],[27988,"What do you think?

Boehner’s plan to use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes to raise the debt limit appeared aimed at reassuring colleagues that he would not let the economic crisis spiral further out of control.

Sanders also praised the Capitol Police. “These guys are very well trained and they do a good job,” Sanders said on MSNBC. \"As soon as the shots were fired, Sen.

Bernard Sanders told ABC News that it is \"a national disgrace\" that the Capitol Police are not being paid during the shutdown, The Washington Post reported.

Sanders voiced concern that the same tactics by the same small band of extremists could have more dire consequences if the nation’s debt ceiling isn’t raised by mid-October.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \n\nNo End in Sight to Government Shutdown: Lawmakers and the White House dug in Tuesday for a long fight as the first federal government shutdown in nearly two decades showed no signs of breaking. The closure, triggered by a congressional fight over President Obama’s health care law, means 800,000 federal workers were off the job on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said shutdown effects ranged from cancer patients not getting care they need to FBI agents are not reporting to work. Seventeen out of 30 staffers who work for U.S. Sen.

Democrats in Congress hold Republicans to blame for using underhand methods to overturn a health care law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court and endorsed by voters at the last presidential election. “If we surrender to hostage-taking tonight,” Sen. Sanders said in The Guardian, “these guys would be back within a couple of weeks without a shadow of a doubt. What we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinary anti-democratic act.” \n\nHostage Crisis: “People may disagree about the Affordable Care Act, but it is wrong for right-wing Republicans to ignore the results of the last election and hold the American people hostage by threatening to shut down the government unless they get their way,” Sen. Sanders said in the St. Albans Messenger. \n\nClosure Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating.” In Vermont, passport offices like one in St. Albans could close, people applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays, programs to help small businesses and Head Start might shut down, and people applying for Social Security, Medicare and veterans’ benefits will face a significantly slower process, the Bennington Banner reported. The same article said Gov.

Sanders welcomed a debate over health care, but blasted the tactics of right-wing Republicans in the House using a government shutdown to try to get their way. “What this debate is about is blackmail and hostage-taking,” he said, “and that is unacceptable.”\n\nWatch the speech here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_DSPSFXKxs\u0026feature=share\u0026list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA","2013-09-30 23:01:35+00","9124187907_10151870285672908",15],[28021,"Senate Votes Again to Avoid Shutdown: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-votes-again-to-avoid-shutdown\r\nTake the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll","2013-09-30 19:26:28+00","9124187907_10151869922797908",15],[28022,"Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): \n\nGovernment Heads Toward Shutdown: The nation braced for a partial shutdown of the federal government, as time for Congress to pass a budget before a Monday midnight deadline grew perilously short and lawmakers gave no signs Sunday they were moving toward a resolution. Leaders of both parties said they wanted to avoid the first federal closure since 1996, but their public appearances seemed aimed more at affixing blame for the impasse, The Wall Street Journal reported. \n\nShutdown Nears: The U.S. government appeared on Sunday to be on the verge of shutting down for the first time in nearly two decades as House leaders were running out of time and options to keep it open. University of Maryland political scientist Roy Meyers suggested Republican leadership probably doesn’t want to relive the last government shutdown when Republicans were blamed more than President Clinton for the shutdowns. Thirty-six senators, including then-Rep. Bernie Sanders, experienced the 1995-96 shutdowns compared to just 20 percent of House members. “I would be surprised if any of them would want to repeat the experience,” Meyers told The Hill. \n\nLow-Wage Workers: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy are among 15 senators who signed a letter to President Obama calling for workers in companies that get federal contracts to be paid at least $10.10 per hour. They urged the president to issue an executive order that would essentially set a minimum wage for federal contractors, WPTZ-TV reported on Monday. \n\nHealth Care: Obama administration officials scrambled to get insurance marketplaces open on Tuesday. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act is expected to proceed even if the government partially shuts down. Sen. Sanders called the new law a welcome but small step. A single-payer system, like Medicare, is a fairer and more efficient way to give all Americans health care, Sanders wrote in a column for The Guardian.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/093013","2013-09-30 13:36:30+00","9124187907_10151869319897908",15],[28024,"Senators Urge Obama to Set Minimum Wage for Federal Contract Workers: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-urge-obama-to-set-minimum-wage-for-federal-contract-workers","2013-09-28 23:27:10+00","9124187907_10151866162692908",15],[28026,"The Week in Review:\n\nThe Senate voted on Friday for a stopgap spending measure after stripping out a House-passed provision to defund Obamacare.

Bernie Sanders told the Burlington Free Press. “It is also wrong to force many federal workers to take furloughs – resulting in significant cuts in pay.” \n\nBullies: Sen. Sanders on Monday criticized a House-passed bill that would cut nutrition programs by $39 billion. “What you’re talking about is the incredible cruelty and arrogance of a party representing the wealthy and the powerful to punish the poor and working people,” Sanders said. “These are bullies who are beating up on helpless people … They don’t impress me.” Sanders told MSNBC's Martin Bashir. \n\nOff the Deep End: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday said a shutdown would “make the United States look incredibly stupid throughout the world” and the threat by Republicans to close the government unless they get their way “makes every American ask, ‘What in god’s name is going on in Washington.’” At a time of massive poverty and falling incomes for middle-class, working families, Sanders said on The Bill Press Show that cutting food stamps, Head Start, Meals on Wheels and other programs is an “absolutely crazy” idea pushed by right-wing Republicans “going off the deep end.” \n\nThe Fed: Few remember that 30 senators voted against Ben Bernanke when President Barack Obama nominated him for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2010, Juan Williams wrote for The Hill.

With a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria's bloody and complicated civil war.\n\nThere are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.'s military intervention in Syria.\n\nFirst, of course, is the much discussed \"war weariness.\" The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years, and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years. The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6,700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care. Further, as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.\n\nBut there's another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years. And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.\n\nHere's the truth. The middle class in this country is collapsing.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Huffington Post: \n\nAt a time of great political division in our country President Obama has found a remarkable way to unite Americans of all political persuasions -- conservatives, progressives and moderates.  With a loud and clear voice the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria’s bloody and complicated civil war.\n\n            There are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.’s military intervention in Syria.  \n\n            First, of course, is the much discussed “war weariness.”  The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years, and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years.  The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6,700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care.  Further, as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.  \n\n            But there’s another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years.  And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.  \n\n            Here’s the truth.  The middle class in this country is collapsing. The number of Americans living in poverty is nearly the highest on record and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider.

Sanders Airs Concerns on Syria:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this afternoon reiterated his concerns about U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war. \nIn an interview on MSNBC, Sanders made three points.\nFirst, he said that more than 9 out of 10 calls and emails to his office in the past week were against unilateral U.S. action against Syria. “The calls that are coming into my office are overwhelmingly against getting involved in a bloody and complicated civil war in Syria,” Sanders told anchor Alex Witt.\n\nSecond, at a time when the U.S. faces major domestic crises in terms of high unemployment, low wages, massive income and wealth inequality and the planetary threat of global warming, he feared very much that U.S. involvement in Syria would make it even harder for the U.S. government to address the enormous problems facing the American middle class. “The American people are profoundly disgusted with the fact that the United States Congress continues to ignore the enormously serious problems facing the middle class of this country,” Sanders said.\n\nThird, the senator worried that the “surgical strike” against Syria advocated by President Barack Obama could turn into a much deeper engagement and a push for “regime change.” He noted that a resolution passed last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee contained language that could become a basis for broader U.S. involvement. If that occurred, the U.S. involvement could take years, cost billions of dollars and possibly involve U.S. troops. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=c4d5e9a2-c0aa-4026-abf3-c86cf680f868","2013-09-08 22:10:00+00","9124187907_10151820074207908",15],[28095,"The Crisis at Home: http://youtu.be/nQS7Dnvyg60","2013-09-08 18:26:37+00","9124187907_10151819828617908",15],[28097,"Coming up at 1pmET: Sen.

But in the past three recessions since 1986—and especially the 2007-2009 downturn—companies minimized wage cuts and instead let workers go to keep remaining workers happy. As a result, to compensate for the wage cuts that never were made, businesses now may be capping wage growth. \"As the economy recovers, pent-up wage cuts will probably continue to slow wage growth long after the unemployment rate has returned to more normal levels,\" the researchers said.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=67330205-4852-4ca1-914f-cfbef87ffc13","2013-08-26 18:07:27+00","9124187907_10151790247542908",15],[28132,"Today's news from Sen.

Sanders said he was disappointed by a federal appeals court ruling that rejected the state’s attempt to close the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, Vermont Public Radio reported on Wednesday. Sanders said Vermont should be able to close the plant on economic grounds. \"We have a nuclear power plant which is antiquated, which is of the same design as the plant in Fukushima.

Obama's proposal clashed with ideas offered by the House and Senate tax committee chairmen who solicited ideas from members. Sen. Sanders, for example, suggested imposing a 0.03 percent tax on the sale of financial instruments like credit default swaps, derivatives, stock options and futures, as well as a tax on carbon and methane emissions and higher capital-gains and dividend tax rates for affluent investors, The New York Times reported. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=6426DCF4-AF1A-4FC9-BB9D-D6E60384E5D8","2013-07-31 13:34:09+00","9124187907_10151734378552908",15],[28204,"Cutting Edge Healthcare for Veterans: \n\nSenate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders today joined the Department of Veterans Affairs at an exhibit of cutting-edge medical technology that is improving treatment and expanding access to care for million veterans throughout the country.\n\nDr. Robert Petzel, VA’s undersecretary for health, said VA medical centers are in the forefront of what he predicted will be an “explosion” in computer and communications technology that lets patients and doctors interact more efficiently and effectively. \n\nRead more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=FA3A4839-1A5B-4333-A2C2-65B404E8C72E\n\nWatch the video here: http://youtu.be/4JTCLh-JvhY","2013-07-30 19:32:09+00","9124187907_10151732978302908",15],[28205,"Today's news from Sen.

That’s when the sharpest increases in interest rates are expected to occur. “The idea of passing legislation that in a few years is going to make an already bad situation of student indebtedness even worse is absolutely absurd,” Sanders had said in a floor speech earlier in the day calling for the two-year sunset provision.

The bill would peg loan rates to the 10-year Treasury note. Sens.

Bernie Sanders said on my radio show this week, it is not enough,” Ed Schultz said Sunday on MSNBC. Schultz said Sanders was “spot on” when he said, “The real issue is how do we deal with the overall dysfunctionality of the United States Senate where the enormous problems in our country – the high unemployment, the growing gap between the wealthy and everybody else, the issue a climate change, the fact that many kids can't afford to go to college right now, crumbling infrastructure … – we're not getting … even serious debates on these issues.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), POLITICO: \n\nIf a nation were judged by how well it cares for its weakest and most vulnerable citizens, the United States would not get high marks.\n\nIn America today, while the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, poverty among seniors is increasing and nearly half of all seniors are now unable to afford their basic living expenses, according to a recent study from the Economic Policy Institute. Four million seniors live on less than $11,000 a year, and 8 million seniors face the threat of hunger. Tragically, according to the AARP Foundation, the number of hungry seniors in the U.S. more than doubled from 2001 to 2009. As distressing as these national statistics are, poverty and hunger are even worse for older women, minorities and those living in rural communities.\n\nOne of the most effective programs devised to address the needs of vulnerable seniors is the Older Americans Act. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 along with the better-known Medicare and Medicaid programs. In an extremely cost-effective way, this program is providing high-quality nutrition to more than 1 million frail and isolated older adults through the Meals on Wheels program. It also provides subsidized meals at senior centers throughout the country and employment opportunities for low-income older Americans.\n\nThis is a program that not only works well in easing isolation, hunger and suffering, it also saves taxpayers substantial sums of money. Not surprisingly, seniors who are malnourished are more likely to suffer serious illnesses, to break hips because of a fall or, for a variety of reasons, end up in hospital emergency rooms at great expense. To my mind, it makes a lot more sense to provide adequate nutrition to frail seniors than to spend money on preventable hospital costs. The simple truth is, we can feed a senior for an entire year for the cost of one day in a hospital. Further, a Brown University study determined that providing adequate nutrition reduces the need for nursing home care, which costs $80,000 per year.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/keep-meals-on-wheels-to-deliver-security-to-many-92989.html#ixzz2WgCXM0gj","2013-06-19 16:19:39+00","9124187907_10151648669017908",15],[28308,"VIDEO: NSA Snooping: http://youtu.be/s4jdE3fks1Q","2013-06-18 16:50:46+00","9124187907_10151646939392908",15],[28309,"Today's news from Sen.

He wants the federal government to prove that the records of a specific individual deserve to be examined. “I want the government to be able to go after that person, but I do not want to see records of hundreds of millions of Americans assembled by the United States government,” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio in a report broadcast on Monday.“\n\nDomestic Spying: “An administration run by supposed liberals thinks that it's ok for government to secretly seize phone and Internet records of citizens, without the kind of explicit search warrant contemplated by the Fourth Amendment. The conservatives who controlled the federal government in the Bush administration were even more cavalier about trampling citizen rights.

Last year, fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of U.S. phone records gathered daily by the NSA.

Bernie Sanders: \n\nThe front pages of American newspapers are filled with stories about how the US economy is recovering. There is some truth to that. Since President George W Bush left office in 2008, significant progress has been made in moving our economy out of the abyss of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But in the midst of this slow recovery, we must not accept a \"new normal\".\n\nWe must not be content with an economic reality in which the middle class of this country continues to disappear, poverty is near an all-time high and the gap between the very rich and everyone else grows wider and wider.\n\nThe good news is that instead of losing more than 700,000 jobs a month as we were five years ago, we've been gaining almost 200,000 jobs a month since January. The bad news is that, in addition to those job numbers being much too low, nearly 60% of the jobs gained since the \"recovery\" are low-wage jobs that pay less than $14 an hour, while most of the jobs lost during the recession were decent-paying middle-class jobs.\n\nThe good news is that the official unemployment rate has gone down from 10% in October of 2009 to 7.5% in April. The bad news is that 20 million Americans still are looking for work and the real unemployment rate – counting those who have given up looking for work and those working part time when they need full time jobs – is 13.9% The very bad news is that youth and minority unemployment is far higher than that and, with the decline in factory jobs, income for poorly educated men has shrunk by nearly two-thirds over the past four decades. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/02/us-economy-recovery-wealth-inequality","2013-06-02 16:10:00+00","9124187907_10151616736082908",15],[28372,"You can also follow Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nImmigration Reform: Sen. Sanders supports a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants already in the United States and backs a proposal to let their children go to college or join the military. He is concerned, however, about “an all-out effort” by some American employers “to bring in cheap labor” to replace U.S. workers. “A whole lot of kids in this country need jobs,” he said, but employers would rather pay less to hire foreigners as lifeguards or ski instructors, Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. He also said high-tech companies should offer better pay to attract American engineers instead of taking advantage of skilled foreigners who will work for less.\nGuest Workers Sen. Sanders and others in the Democratic Caucus remain concerned about the controversial guest-worker provisions in the immigration bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. One way an immigration reform bill could fail would be defections from the left over those provisions that critics say would undermine low-income Americans’ employment opportunities. Sens. Boxer, Brown, Harkin, and Sanders opposed an earlier bill for that reason, but “they’re all likely ‘yes’ votes this time around, with Brown, Harkin and Boxer signaling support already,” according to an online Washington Post analysis.\n \nVA Claims Backlog: The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs expressed skepticism about proposals to create a presidential commission to examine an enormous backlog of veterans’ disability claims. Sen. Sanders said a presidential panel, which has been pushed by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, would be unlikely to solve the problem. “You bring these people together for 18 more hearings, and in the real world, that slows down the progress you’re making,” Sanders said on C-SPAN’s Newsmakers and The Washington Post online.\n \nSanders Supports Shinseki: Sen. Sanders stood behind the embattled VA Secretary Eric Shinseki,, reported Politico. “We have serious people undertaking a very difficult job, and you can take pot shots at them all of the time.

That is, while official unemployment today is at about 7.5 percent, real unemployment, counting those people who have given up looking for work or people working part-time when they want to work full-time, is almost 14 percent. And if you look at young people unemployment or minority unemployment, the numbers are way, way higher than that. More significantly, if you look at the trends impacting the middle class from way, way back, median middle income has gone down $5,000 and most jobs today are not good-paying jobs. They're low-paying jobs.\n\n“And perhaps most frightening is we're seeing more income and wealth inequality in America. So between 2009 and 2011 all of the income in America went to the top 1 percent and in terms of wealth, the gap between the very, very rich and everybody else is as wide as it has been since the 1920s.”\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=11A3E6AD-3815-4400-B2A1-21D5F0865F3C","2013-05-29 22:04:57+00","9124187907_10151610323127908",15],[28363,"Today's news from Sen.

Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he remains unbowed in his fight to give states the right to require that manufacturers of GMO foods label their products. “I have not the slightest doubt that the momentum is with us,” Sanders said in an interview Tuesday with CNN’s Jake Tapper a week after the U.S. Senate defeated his proposed amendment to the farm bill on food labels. Two million people in more than 50 countries marched over the weekend to protest Monsanto, the giant $58 billion multinational corporation that produces pesticides and genetically modified seeds designed to resist lethal chemicals, according to CNN. \n\nFood Labels: With politicians in New York, Connecticut and Vermont pursuing bills to mandate GMO labeling, Sen. Sanders said it made sense to pass a federal law so that individual states wouldn’t be hit with lawsuits from GMO food giants like Monsanto and DuPont, the New York Daily News reported.  “There are about 27 states in this country that are moving forward on the labeling of GMO food … So all that my legislation said is that if … states want to go forward, Monsanto and these other large corporations cannot sue them,” Sanders said. Around the world, dozens of countries already require labels, Sanders said in a blog posted at Nation of Change. \n\nDental Care: The Northern Tier Centers for Health will expand its dental services in Swanton, Vt., according to the St. Albans Messenger. The clinic that opened in 2010 treats patients on a sliding fee scale so those without insurance can still find care. “We have a major dental care crisis,” said Sen.

After all, if we take at face value the claims made back in 2008 by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse.\n\nBut now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.\n\nMost people are now familiar with President's Obama's proposal to cut Social Security by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).

That may soon change.\n\nIn last year’s “fiscal cliff” debate, President Obama offered to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security benefits, a spending cut favored by Republicans and scorned by Democrats. Republicans rejected the offer because Mr. Obama wanted tax increases in exchange, while Democrats said it would be too harmful. More recently, Senate Democrats did not include Social Security reforms in their budget and specifically rejected a COLA cut. The House Republican budget also steered clear of explicit cuts to Social Security, a move partly aimed at isolating Mr. Obama.\n\nThe question now is whether Mr. Obama will again propose to cut the COLA when he unveils his budget next week. We think he should not do so. The president might want to seem like he is willing to compromise by renewing his call for a COLA cut. But Republicans already spurned his offer and are unlikely to take him up on it now. They are more likely to paint him as a foe of Social Security, which would be reinforced by Democrats’ opposition to the cut.\n\nEven if Mr. Obama avoided those pitfalls, a COLA cut is a bad idea, as we will explain in this editorial.

The vote put the Senate on record against the proposal that President Barack Obama had floated as a way also to reduce costs for Social Security and other federal programs that are adjusted for inflation. \"My own view is you don't balance the budget on the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in this country,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders Warns Obama: Sen. Sanders is troubled by the president’s plan to change benefit calculations for disability benefits, WPTZ-TV reported on Saturday.

The Senate was expected to vote Friday evening on amendments by Sen. Bernie Sanders. One would put the Senate on record against cutting benefits for Social Security and disabled veterans. The other would take a stand against offshore tax havens that are used by profitable corporations and wealthy individuals to shelter income, a tax loophole that costs about $100 billion a year.  On Wednesday, Sanders chaired a hearing on how veteran suicides and how the Department of Veterans Affairs is caring for troops returning from war zones.

President Barack Obama told a news conference in Jerusalem that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would change U.S. policy and require action from the international community. In Washington, senators in both parties made it clear that they want the White House to consult with Congress before taking action in Syria, particularly if it involves U.S. military intervention. Sen. Bernie Sanders told Congressional Quarterly there is strong opposition in the country to any more wars. “Today we acknowledged the 10th anniversary of the war in Iraq, the significant loss of life. ... I don’t think the American people are anxious to get into another war.” \n\nVeterans Mental Health: Sen. Sanders chaired a hearing Wednesday to examine whether veterans have timely access to quality mental health care, the Burlington Free Press reported. About 22 veterans commit suicide every day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sanders said a key role is played by organizations such as the Vermont Veterans Outreach Program which provides assistance to returning veterans and their families. The Vermont program relies on a team of 10 combat veterans who have had to cope with adjusting to life at home after fighting overseas, said Andre Wing, the program’s team leader. \n\nWind Power: The Vermont Senate delayed a vote on a bill that would subject renewable energy projects to more regulation, Vermont Public Radio reported. Sen. Sanders stepped into the fray last month, expressing opposition to what he and others see as an obstacle to wind power projects in Vermont. Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, said he's on the side of the majority Vermonters, not just the renewable industry. “We're standing with real champions on climate and energy issues like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben,” Burns said in the Valley News. A Rutland Herald column and a letter to the editor commented on the controversy. \n\nGrand Bargain: “Which is worse, indefinite sequestration or a grand bargain that includes serious entitlement cuts?  Sen. Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellison, staunch foes of a grand bargain that cuts entitlement benefits, have argued that it’s premature to get drawn into this choice.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):\n\nThe media appear fixated about when and if a so-called “grand bargain” on our economy will be reached. Wrong question! The question we should be asking is: What should be in a “grand bargain” that works for the average American?\n\nAt a time when the middle class is disappearing, 46 million Americans are living in poverty and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, we need a “grand bargain” that protects struggling working families, not billionaires.\n\nWith corporate profits at record-breaking levels while the effective corporate tax is at its lowest level since 1972, and 1 out of 4 profitable corporations pays nothing in federal income taxes, we need a grand bargain that ends corporate loopholes and demands that corporate America starts helping us with deficit reduction. We must not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must not cut Social Security, disabled veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs that provide opportunity and dignity to millions of struggling American families.\n\nBefore we pass a grand bargain, we have got to take a hard and sober look at what’s happening economically in our country today. In doing so, we must acknowledge that the United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth and that inequality is worse today than at any time since the late 1920s. Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America — 150 million Americans. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. Incredibly, the Federal Reserve reported last year that median net worth for middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007-2010. That’s the equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average middle-class family. \n\nThe distribution of income is even worse. If you can believe it, the last study on the subject showed that all of the new income gained from 2009-2011 went to the top 1 percent.

Bernie Sanders told The Wall Street Journal and United Press International after leaving the meeting with the president. “I’m going to fight as hard as I can to make the point that Social Security has not contributed on nickel to the deficit,” Sanders said Wednesday morning on National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition.” \n\nObama Challenged on Social Security: Sens.

Harkin told Politico that Obama's response to his and Sanders’ concerns was “basically things are open for negotiation.\" \n\nSanders Made Case for Veterans: Beyond Social Security, Sanders said he specifically highlighted to the president what Chained CPI would do to veterans, The Nation reported. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new formula would cost a veteran who began receiving benefits at 30 $1,425 at age 45 and $3,231 at age 65. “I just don’t think that this president should develop a legacy to be the guy who cuts back on benefits for people who lost their arms and legs in Iraq and Afghanistan, or widows who lost their husbands,” said Sanders. \n\nSign Bernie’s Petition: “I am prepared to work with other progressives to do everything we can to make sure that the budget is not balanced on a collapsing middle class and on 46 million people who are living poverty and on many elderly people who are barely keeping their heads above water economically,” Sen.

Sanders and others in Congress are ratcheting up pressure on President Barack Obama to back away from a proposal to cut Social Security benefits. They’re concerned Obama may strike a deficit-reduction deal with Republicans that would reduce Social Security benefits by adopting a less generous way of adjusting benefits for inflation, The Hill reported.\n \nObama’s ‘Horrendous Idea’: “It’s a horrendous idea. It is totally absurd because for a start, Social Security has not contributed one penny to the deficit … But it`s not just seniors on Social Security. If you can believe it, this chained CPI will make devastating cuts for disabled veterans. The men and women who lost arms and legs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the widows of people who were killed in Iraq -- it will mean significant cuts for them,” Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. \n\nGrand Bargain: President Obama dined Wednesday with 12 Republican senators, lunched Thursday at the White House with House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and will visit Senate and House Republican caucuses on Capitol Hill next week to revive hopes for his “grand bargain” on a budget. Sen. Sanders ripped the president for wanting to cut Social Security and veterans’ benefits by adopting a stingier gauge of inflation. “The president historically has not been a strong negotiator,” he told Congressional Quarterly. “The fear is he is going to get a deal that will probably not be strong enough on revenue. That does worry some of us.”\n \nStrengthen Social Security: Sen. Sanders introduced legislation Thursday to strengthen Social Security. The bill would apply the payroll tax to all income over $250,000 a year, The Hill and KCSB-FM in Santa Barbara, Calif. reported. “You do that, it hits the top 1 1/2 percent.

Sen. Bernie Sanders was among those voting no. The final vote was 63 to 34 to confirm the nomination of the former intelligence officer who held posts under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. During Brennan’s confirmation process, questions were raised about the use of drone aircraft and so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. “While we must aggressively pursue international terrorists and all of those who would do us harm, we must do it in a way that protects the Constitution and the civil liberties which make us proud to be Americans,” Sanders said. “With regard to the use of drones and other methods employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, I am not convinced that Mr. Brennan is adequately sensitive to the important balancing act required to make protecting our civil liberties an integral part of ensuring our national security.”\n\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=17A0F22D-BC56-453C-BE71-290CE220095B","2013-03-07 22:31:24+00","9124187907_626897670660312",15],[28590,"Today's news from Sen.

Rebates to consumers would reduce the impact of the tax on their energy bills. The revenue raised also would be used to help invest in clean energy technologies and solve our budget problems. “We will never fully deal with this crisis until Congress passes strong legislation.

Although U.S. carbon emissions are falling at the moment, many analysts think we’ll ultimately need a price on carbon to ensure the trend continues. Last week, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sanders unveiled a bill that would impose a carbon tax in the United States starting at $20 per ton, The Washington Post reported online. \n\nNuclear Safety: Sen. Sanders signed on with 11 other senators calling on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enact safety upgrades recommended by its own staff.

Just two years later, at a time of mounting deficits largely created by the recession that Wall Street caused, the major financial institutions did everything they could to avoid paying American taxes by establishing shell corporations in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by the Rutland Herald. \n\nTax Havens: One out of four profitable corporations pays nothing in taxes.

The Vermont values of universal freedom and equality were carried to the highest office in the country by two American presidents who called Vermont their birth-state.\n\nChester Alan Arthur was the 21st president of the United States, born in North Fairfield, Vt. on October 5, 1829. He was the son of a Vermont native, Malvina Stone and  William Arthur, an abolitionist Baptist preacher who immigrated to North America from Ireland. Arthur was a colonel in the American Civil War, in charge of outfitting and housing troops in New York. He was  elected vice president on the Republican ticket of 1880 and assumed the presidency after the assassination of President James A. Garfield. President Arthur continued his father’s quest to restore equality for all Americans after the end of Reconstruction, defending the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and increasing education funding for Native Americans.\n\nCalvin Coolidge, the 30th president famously known as “Silent Cal,” was born in Plymouth, Vt. on Independence Day in 1872. Like Arthur, President Coolidge assumed the office after serving as Vice President when President Warren G. Harding passed away in 1923. President Coolidge received the news while visiting Vermont and signed the oath of office by light of a kerosene lamp, administered by his father, John Sr., who was a notary. Coolidge also fought for civil rights in a post-war era, reducing the influence of the Ku Klux Klan by keeping them from appointed office. He also signed the Indian Citizenship Act granting full U.S. citizenship to Native Americans while allowing them to retain their land and cultural rights.\n\nVermont can list Arthur and Coolidge with pride among its many citizens who have made a positive difference in American history. Both men are bound together by the unforeseen circumstances that bestowed the presidency upon them and by the actions that helped advance the tradition of equality and civil rights that Vermont still fights for today.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1A1C346F-F1FB-42CE-B6FC-2AD84B0E7A9D","2013-02-18 17:30:01+00","9124187907_425495530866778",15],[28634,"Today's news from Sen.

Sanders warned in Congressional Quarterly. “Wall Street billionaires and other supporters claim that changing the consumer price index is a ‘minor tweak.’ Tell that to the millions of senior citizens trying to survive on just $14,000 a year whose Social Security benefits would be cut overall by $112 billion during the next decade,” Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by The Hill. \n\nGlobal Warming: Sen.

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday cosponsored legislation by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to replace the across-the-board cuts. The proposal would raise $960 billion by closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. “At a time when revenue is near a 60-year low in terms of GDP and when corporations are doing phenomenally well while the middle class in America is collapsing, it is absolutely appropriate to ask corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes so we don’t balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the young, the sick and the poor,” Sanders said on Monday. Sanders last Thursday proposed his own bill to stop letting profitable corporations shelter income in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax shelters (S.250). “Wall Street banks and large companies love America when they need corporate welfare.

Sanders is fighting to protect Social Security while House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan wants to lower cost-of-living adjustments and drastically cut benefits. “Despite the fact that Social Security can pay out every benefit for the next 21 years, my Republican colleagues and some Democrats are attempting to use the deficit crisis to cut Social Security benefits. That is wrong,” Sanders said on ABC 22 and Fox 44.\n\nWind Energy: Foes of ridgeline wind development descended on the Statehouse Thursday to counter statements by Sen. Sanders that a moratorium would send a terrible message to the rest of the country about Vermont’s commitment to address global warming, WPTZ-TV reported. “Activist Bill McKibben praised ridgeline development as has Sen.

Joan McCarter at Daily Kos blamed the doctor shortage on partisan attempts to block funding for the Affordable Care Act. \n\nWind Power: Sen.

House Republican leaders abruptly canceled a vote on the bill after they failed to rally enough votes for passage in an emergency meeting about 8 p.m. Within minutes, dejected Republicans filed out of the basement meeting room and declared there would be no votes to avert the “fiscal cliff” until after Christmas, The New York Times reported. \n\nNow What?: His leadership team’s inability to push Speaker Boehner’s tax proposal through the House raises new doubt about Boehner’s power to rally his conference behind any deficit reduction agreement Republicans might negotiate with the White House.

Fifty-seven million people in the United States live in areas with a shortage of primary-care providers, according to Sanders, and as more people gain insurance and seek care – and baby-boomer physicians begin to retire – the situation will only grow worse. Sanders' Primary Health and Aging Subcommittee will address the topic in a hearing today, National Journal reported. \n\nWind Energy: Sen. Sanders held a news conference Monday to oppose a three-year moratorium on wind power projects proposed in the Vermont state Senate, The Associated Press reported. “If Vermont ceases new wind development the message will go out all across the country that even in progressive Vermont there is not a serious commitment to combating global warming,” Sanders said in reports in the AP report in the Bennington Banner, Brattleboro Reformer, Rutland Herald, Times Argus. \n\nGlobal Warming: Sen. Sanders is going to introduce legislation in Congress to combat global warming by imposing a tax on carbon that will include \"massive investments\" in renewable energy.

The overwhelming scientific consensus is clear. Unless we take bold action soon the temperature of our planet could rise by up to 8 degrees Fahrenheit.  That would be catastrophic.

My legislation will end fossil fuel subsidies, and as the president called for, make historic investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass.

Organizers also gave the congressional delegation about 1,000 free tickets for constituents to sit or stand on the lawn surrounding the U.S. Capitol during the ceremony, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. \n\nTreasury Secretary: Jacob S.

Sanders saying, “We need a Treasury secretary who is prepared to stand up to corporate America and their powerful lobbyists and fight for policies that protect the working families in our country.

The move shocked Congressional Democrats and dismayed Mr. Obama’s liberal base.\n\nThe offer, however, was rejected by House Republicans who could not stomach the tax increases and other concessions that Mr. Obama demanded as part of the deal. The talks moved on, and when all was said and done, Republicans did not get the lower cost-of-living adjustments (known as COLAs) and Mr. Obama did not get the concessions he had sought.\n\nBut that is not the end of the story. As the next round of deficit reduction talks gets under way, the administration seems determined to include the COLA cut in any new package of spending reductions. Rather than using the issue as a bargaining ploy, the administration appears to have embraced it as a worthy end in itself.\n\nIs it? In a word, no.\n\nThat is not to say that Social Security should be off the table. There are reforms that are eminently sensible, if only the political will could be found to enact them. But reducing the COLA is not a sound idea now and may never be.\n\nAt issue is the way inflation is calculated. The administration’s offer in the fiscal cliff talks — and the approach long advocated by Republicans — calls for using a new measure of inflation, called the “chained” Consumer Price Index, to calculate the COLA.\n\nUnlike the gauge of inflation currently in use, the chained index captures the ability of consumers to adjust their spending across categories as relative prices change — for instance, spending less on fuel as gas prices go up and more on groceries as food prices go down. Such substitution causes the chained C.P.I. to rise more slowly than the current measure, which would result in a lower annual COLA and huge budget savings. The move to a chained C.P.I. would reduce benefits by some $135 billion over 10 years, and far more in later decades because of compounding.\n\nThe administration and other proponents of switching to a chained C.P.I. contend that it is a technical fix in the interest of greater accuracy, not a benefit cut per se.\n\nBut that claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The chained index is in many ways a better method of tracking price changes for the broad working population, but there is no compelling evidence that it is better for computing the Social Security COLA.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/misguided-social-security-reform.html","2013-01-14 23:25:15+00","9124187907_126073060893793",15],[28735,"Today's news from Sen.

Key backers in Congress said will not give in to pressure to cut benefits. “If we are going to protect programs that working families desperately need and create the millions of jobs our economy needs we need more revenue,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. He noted that government revenue is now 15.4 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest in 60 years. He argued that the wealthiest Americans and corporations should be paying more taxes. “We need more revenue from the wealthy and large corporations, so what I will do as part of this process is make sure we close these loopholes and ask corporations to start paying their fair share,” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. \n\nProtect Social Security: “Republicans — and some Democrats — want to curtail Social Security, veterans’ benefits, Medicare and Medicaid — that’s not a secret — and some of us are going to be fighting to say no,” Sen. Sanders told Politico. He is the author of a letter sent by 29 Senate Democrats in September demanding Obama back off Social Security cuts by changing the index for inflation. “It is absolutely imperative the president and Democratic leadership stay strong on this issue. If they do, we will win,” added Sanders. \n\nProtect Veterans: Sen. Sanders led seniors and veterans groups in stopping retirement and disability benefits from being cut in the year-end fiscal deal, according to The Ed Schultz Show.

Bernie will vigorously oppose Republicans and President Obama and anyone else who wants to balance the budget on the backs of seniors.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=14E7AB43-8CB1-4DBA-9EC5-5846AB09CEAA","2012-12-20 23:31:04+00","9124187907_10151294675537908",15],[28806,"Listen to the American People: http://youtu.be/2kdcyyL4bb0","2012-12-19 02:54:57+00","9124187907_131383847019847",15],[28807,"Listen to the American People: http://youtu.be/2kdcyyL4bb0","2012-12-19 02:54:00+00","9124187907_322435127871050",15],[28808,"Today's news from Sen.

The powerful lobby group for seniors AARP and the AFL-CIO labor federation were upset. So was Sen. Bernard Sanders, according to Reuters. \"The last thing you want to do is cut Social Security benefits,\" said Sanders. \n\nSanders to Obama: Don’t be Bullied: Sen. Sanders cited a poll Tuesday in The Washington Post that found that Americans overwhelmingly say do not cut Social Security, do not cut Medicare, do not cut Medicaid. And 74 percent agreed that people making more than $250,000 a year should pay more in taxes. “The president has got to listen to the American people and stand firm against the bullies in the Republican House,” Sanders said on “The Ed Show” on MSNBC. \n\nA ‘Massive Betrayal’: President Obama and congressional Republicans are proposing to cut Social Security. This is what Democrats – and most Republicans – said during the recently finished campaign that they would never do. If Obama cuts the deal, he will in the words of CREDO political director Becky Bond be engaging in a “massive betrayal,” John Nichols blogged for The Nation. No one will be surprised that Sen. Sanders, a stalwart defender of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is objecting. “I want him to keep that promise,” Sanders says of the president. \n\nMedia Monopolies: In 1983, 90 percent of the American media was owned by 50 companies. Today, that same 90 percent is controlled by just six corporations: GE, NewsCorp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS, Sen.

B4), Associated Press, Politico and Stars and Stripes reported. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Sen. Bernie Sanders said cuts in benefits for more than 3 million disabled veterans and their families should not be part of the fiscal cliff deal. “Tell the White House and the leadership in Congress, ‘Do not balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans who have lost their arms, their legs and their eyesight defending our country,’” Sanders said on WCAX-TV. \n\nSocial Security: President Obama's offer to limit the growth of Social Security benefits has advocates for seniors worried that Democrats in Congress will break their promise to shield the massive retirement and disability program from cuts in deficit reduction talks. “The American people are saying let's do deficit reduction, but do it in a way that is fair,” Sen. Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC. \n\nObama Breaks Promise to Seniors: Many of Obama's supporters are angry with his new plan because it includes a stingier formula for cost of living increases known as chained CPI, which would hold down Social Security adjustments. Sanders said the White House repeatedly assured him that would not happen “and that Social Security should be off the table in terms of deficit reduction. I heard that many, many times. So I wonder how Social Security suddenly has gotten back on the table, including a chained CPI with devastating cuts to seniors and disabled vets,” Sanders said on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered. \n\nGun Violence: The massacre at a school in Connecticut sparked national discussion on gun control. Sen. Sanders is among those calling for the nation to address what he called “the very serious crisis of lack of mental health care for a whole lot of people who need it.” Sanders told WCAX-TV that improved mental health should be part of the response to a spate of mass murders in America. \"I don't think there's one simple solution, I think you have to look at this thing comprehensively.

Bernie Sanders told Elliot Spitzer on Current TV. “I get nervous that instead of bringing back the old Clinton-era tax rates for the wealthiest people — 39.6 [percent] — there may be a way to wiggle out of that.” \n\nA ‘Raw Deal’: The White House is laying the groundwork for what could be “a raw deal for the middle class,” Ed Schultz said on MSNBC. Obama senior adviser David Plouffe said the deal will blend tax reform and entitlement reform. Sen. Sanders said Plouffe’s remark “concerns me deeply.” Americans do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits, Sanders said, and overwhelming majorities favor making the wealthiest people and the largest corporations help tame the deficit. Citing the latest poll, Schultz concluded that “the public agrees with Sen. Sanders.” \n\nNo New Year’s Cataclysm: If some Democrats had their way, the country wouldn’t be facing the “fiscal cliff” but a “fiscal slope,” “fiscal curve” or even an “austerity crisis.” If there’s no deal by Dec. 31, Obama still has authority to stall in implementing the big tax and spending changes. “This is not like the debt ceiling debate where in fact, if you don’t pay your bills on a certain date, there are very dramatic repercussions,” Sen. Sanders told Politico. “The truth of the matter is we could go into the next year, and if we can reach an agreement in the new Congress, in the first weeks or months or two, I don’t think a whole lot of people will know the difference. So it’s not like something cataclysmic happens on Dec. 31.” \n\nSocial Security: A 2 percent payroll tax cut trumpeted by lawmakers as a way to lift the sagging economy will expire on Dec. 31. Policymakers don't seem too upset. Sen.

Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThe Democrats won a major victory on Election Day.\n\nDespite dozens of billionaires spending huge amounts of money to defeat President Barack Obama, he won a crushing victory in the Electoral College and received 3 million more votes than former Gov. Mitt Romney did nationally. Democrats won 25 of 33 seats contested in the Senate and, to everyone’s surprise, expanded their majority there by two. They also gained seats in the House.\n\nNow, with this victory behind them, the president and congressional Democrats must make it very clear that they will stand with the middle class and working families of our country. These are the people who, because of the Wall Street-caused recession, have seen a significant decline in their family income. These are the people who worry about whether they can afford health care and whether their kids will be able to attend college. The Democrats in the House and Senate must stand with these people — not the millionaires and billionaires who are doing just fine.\n\nMost important, in the coming weeks and months, the Democrats must demand that deficit reduction is done in a way that is fair — and not on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. At a time when real unemployment remains close to 15 percent, we must also focus on creating the millions of jobs that our people need.\nIn America today, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth. Incredibly, the top 1 percent owns 42 percent of the nation’s wealth while the bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. In the last study done on income distribution, we learned that 93 percent of all new income generated between 2009 and 2010 went to the top 1 percent while the bottom 99 percent split the remaining 7 percent. This extraordinary unfairness is not only morally reprehensible, it is bad economics. It will be very difficult to create the jobs that our people need when so many Americans have little or no money to spend.\n\nCongress must pass legislation to create a major jobs program to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. Throughout our country, we need a massive effort to improve our roads, bridges, water and wastewater systems, airports, rail, broadband and cellphone service. Rebuilding our infrastructure makes us more productive and internationally competitive — and creates millions of new jobs.\n\nIn terms of deficit reduction, let us not forget that in 2001, when Bill Clinton left office, this country had a $236 billion surplus. As a result of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that were unpaid for, huge tax breaks for the rich, a Medicare prescription drug program put on the credit card and a significant decline in federal revenues because of the recession, we now have a $1 trillion deficit and a $16 trillion national debt.\n\nCongress must address the deficit situation and the fiscal cliff, but we must do it in a way that is fair. At a time when the wealthiest people in this country are doing extremely well and their effective tax rates are low (think Romney), the people on top must pay their fair share of taxes to help us deal with the deficit. We must also end the outrageous loopholes that allow one out of four large profitable corporations to pay nothing in federal corporate income taxes. Further, it is absurd that current tax policy allows the wealthy and large corporations to avoid paying over $100 billion a year in federal taxes because they stash their money in tax havens in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere.\n\nWe must also take a hard look at wasteful spending in the Defense Department, where we now spend almost as much money as the rest of the world combined. Significant savings can be found at other federal agencies, too.\n\nWhat we must not do, however, is move toward a balanced budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Sadly, that is the approach that virtually all Republicans and some Democrats are advocating. As the founder of the Defending Social Security Caucus, I look forward to working with other members of Congress, the AFL-CIO, senior and disability groups and the vast majority of people in our country who want to prevent cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs vitally important to the working families of America.\n\nIn my view, if the Republicans continue to play an obstructionist role, the president should get out of the Oval Office and travel the country. If he does that, I believe that he will find that there is no state in the country, including those that are very red, where people believe that it makes sense to continue giving huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. I have a strong feeling that when large numbers of constituents all across this country start calling and emailing their senators and members of Congress about this issue, the American people will win this fight.\n\nThe good news is that we are already beginning to see some Republicans make thoughtful comments showing they understand that elections have consequences. Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor, said Sunday that the Republican Party should accept new ideas, including the much criticized suggestion by Democrats that taxes be allowed to go up on the wealthy. “It won’t kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It really won’t, I don’t think. I don’t really understand why Republicans don’t take Obama’s offer.”\n\nKristol is right. At a time when the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider, common sense and justice require the people who are doing extremely well financially to help us in a significant way to reduce deficits.\n\nhttp://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=77bf9eab-7011-4b11-a307-cc2be2b16e","2012-11-19 19:10:50+00","9124187907_198951753563422",15],[28894,"Sen.

If you reduce the outgo of Social Security that money would not go into the general fund to reduce the deficit.  It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.  So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.” The date was Oct. 7, 1984. The occasion was a presidential debate in Louisville, Ky. The president was Ronald Reagan.\n\n“I don't often agree with Ronald Reagan, but he is absolutely right,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday in a Senate floor speech quoting the 40th president. Sanders argued that Social Security should be off the table in negotiations over how to cut deficits. “Yes, we have got to go forward with deficit reduction.

On Thursday, left-leaning lawmakers and seniors groups plan to rally on Capitol Hill against any changes to entitlements. \"We will make it very clear we will not be supportive of cuts to Medicare and Social Security. It would be a huge shock and disappointment if the president forgot the reality that he just won a major victory,\" Sen. Sanders told The Washington Post. \n\nHands Off Social Security: Sen. Sanders says cuts to Social Security should not be a part of any deficit reduction package used to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases slated to take effect Jan. 1., The Associated Press reported. \"Poll after poll after poll that I have seen tell me that the American people do not believe you cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and continue to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires,\" Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. \"Social Security has not contributed a nickel to the deficit, it is independently funded by the payroll tax and has a $2.7 trillion surplus, so let's get Social Security off the table,\" he said on WCAX-TV. \n\nNo Deal Beats Bad Deal: If an acceptable deal on tax increases and spending cuts can't be reached by year's end, briefly going over the \"fiscal cliff\" may be necessary, Sen. Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. \"I would prefer to address it in the next session of Congress to get a good solution than have a bad agreement this session,\" he said on WCAX-TV. Sanders would prefer to reach agreement before Jan. 1 but \"it's not like you're going over the cliff and nothing can be done the day after,\" he said on ABC 22 and Fox 44.

Sanders, a senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, has written a letter to congressional leadership making the case against the use of policies to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for veteran's benefits and Social Security. So far, more than 35 organizations representing veterans, seniors and the disabled have signed onto the letter, according to The Associated Press. \n\nFiscal Crisis: Senior lawmakers moved quickly to take advantage of the postelection political atmosphere to try to strike an agreement that would avert a fiscal crisis early next year when trillions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts begin to go into force, but the forces arrayed against a budget deal remain powerful. Sen. Sanders, a standard-bearer for the left, told The New York Times that virtually all deficit reduction should come from tax increases on the rich, closing loopholes that have allowed profitable corporations to avoid paying any corporate income taxes and cutting military spending.\n\nTake it to the People: \"If we cannot reach an agreement in D.C., which is very likely, because the Republicans will continue to obstruct, I think the president has got to go around this country and say to those people in Oklahoma, in Mississippi, in Alabama, ‘Guess what? This is the issue. Tax breaks for the billionaires, you`re going to cut Social Security, what do you think? Call up your congressman, write to your senator.' We can win this debate,\" Sen.

If you come up with something that solves some critical need, you'll get billions of dollars in prize money, partially funded by the private sector as well as the government. \"But the caveat is, if you win, you have to relinquish all kind o, intellectual property of your innovation.

Many of the bedrock assumptions of American culture - about work, progress, fairness and optimism - are being shaken as successive generations worry about the prospect of declining living standards.

Sanders and 54 other members of Congress earlier this year urged the Food and Drug Administration to implement food labeling on the federal level. He also offered an amendment to the farm bill that would have given states clear-cut authority to require labels. The amendment was offered after state lawmakers in Vermont considered a label law but dropped the effort after a lawsuit was threatened. On Capitol Hill, there also was strong opposition to labeling from food and agriculture industry lobbyists and Sanders' amendment was defeated 73 to 26. Nevertheless, the idea enjoys widespread popular appeal. Californians once favored Proposition 37 by a more than a 2-1 margin. More recent polls, however, give it a narrower eight-point advantage.

Instead of fixing the problem, some in Washington and on Wall Street want to make a bad situation even worse by cutting benefits for senior citizens and veterans through a so-called chained CPI.

They are angry that they are being forced to live through the worst recession in our lifetimes - with sky-high unemployment, with millions of people losing their homes and their life savings. They are angry that they will not have a decent retirement, that they can't afford to send their children to college, that they can't afford health insurance and that, in some cases, they can't even buy the food they need to adequately feed their families.\n\nThey are angry because they know that this recession was not caused by the middle class and working families of this country. It was not caused by the teachers, firefighters and police officers and their unions who are under attack all over the country. It was not caused by construction workers, factory workers, nurses or childcare workers. \n\nThis recession was caused by the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street. And, what makes people furious is that Wall Street still has not learned its lessons. Instead of investing in the job-creating productive economy providing affordable loans to small and medium size businesses, the CEOs of the largest financial institutions in this country have created the largest gambling casino in the history of the world.\n\nFour years ago, after spending billions of dollars to successfully fight for the de-regulation of Wall Street, the CEOs of the big banks - JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and the others, went on a losing streak. The enormous bets they made on worthless, complex, and exotic financial instruments went bad, and they stuck the American people with the bill.\n\nWall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world. But it was not just the $700 billion that Congress approved through the TARP program. As a result of an independent audit that I requested in the Dodd-Frank bill by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office, we now know that the Federal Reserve provided a jaw-dropping $16 trillion in virtually zero interest loans to every major financial institution in this country, large corporations, foreign central banks throughout the world, and some of the wealthiest people in this country.\n\nAnd, instead of using this money to provide affordable loans to small businesses, instead of putting this money back into the job-creating productive economy, what have they done? They have gone back to their days of running the largest gambling casino in the world. In other words, they have learned nothing.\n\nThe American people are angry because they see the great middle class of this country collapsing, poverty increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else grow wider. They are angry because they see this great country, which so many of our veterans fought for and died for, becoming an oligarchy - a nation where our economic and political life are controlled by a handful of billionaire families. \n\nIn the United States today, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income since the 1920s. Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals own more wealth than the bottom half of America - 150 million people. \n\nToday, the six heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune own more wealth than the bottom 30 percent.\n\nToday, the top one percent own 40 percent of all wealth, while the bottom sixty percent owns less than 2 percent. Incredibly, the bottom 40 percent of all Americans own just 3/10ths of one percent of the wealth of the country.\n\nAccording to a new study from the Federal Reserve, median net worth for middle class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007-2010. That's the equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average middle class family.\n\nThe distribution of income is even worse. If you can believe it, the last study on this subject showed that in 2010, 93 percent of all new income created from the previous year went to the top one percent, while the bottom 99 percent of people had the privilege of enjoying the remaining 7 percent. In other words, the rich are getting much richer while almost everyone else is falling behind.\n\nNot only is this inequality of wealth and income morally grotesque, it is bad economic policy. If working families are deeply in debt, and have little or no income to spend on goods and services, how can we expand the economy and create the millions of jobs we desperately need? There is a limit as to how many yachts, mansions, limos and fancy jewelry the super-rich can buy. We need to put income into the hands of working families.","2012-09-03 18:36:42+00","9124187907_420278724696096",15],[29111,"Today's News from Sen.
