It keeps getting worse. The more you hear about the deal, the less confident you are. I'll tell you the discussions of the inspection regime, they're classified, but they produce no comfort or security, whatsoever. At the end of the day the inspection regime we all know about the 24-days notice, which is a delay that is designed only to give the Iranian regime time to cover up their nuclear program.\n\nBut hearing the specific details, this deal is not materially different than simply calling the Iranian supreme leader, asking if they're developing nuclear weapons, and taking his word for it when he says ‘no.' \n\nThe idea that we would trust Iran to inspect their own facilities takes a level of gullibility and naiveté that exceeds the standards even of the Obama Administration. Nobody would sign this agreement without knowing full well that the predictable and certain outcome of this agreement is that Iran will acquire nuclear weapons. And no one in their right mind would want a regime that is led by a radical, theocratic Ayatollah, who chants ‘Death to America,' to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nIn my view, the Iranian nuclear deal is catastrophic, and there is no higher priority over the next 60 days than to energize and mobilize the American people to reach out to every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, and urge them to reject this deal.\n\nIn my view, the vote on this deal will be the most important vote any member of the Senate casts, likely, in his or her entire career. And the focus in particular, should be on Senate Democrats and Congressional Democrats because they face a fundamental choice: Will they put first the national security of our country, the safety and security of our friends and allies, the safety and security of the Nation of Israel, and the lives of millions of Americans? Or will they put first, instead, partisan loyalty to the Obama White House. I very much hope and pray we see a reemergence of Joe Lieberman Democrats, we see a reemergence of Scoop Jackson Democrats, of John F. Kennedy Democrats, of Democrats who say ‘My first priority is representing and defending the United States of America and keeping this nation first trumps any level of partisan loyalty.'

Toxic gasses filled the air; planes swooped below; and machine guns buzzed well into the night. In the first two days, the Division lost roughly 1,600 men. But they kept fighting, held the line, and captured over 600 enemy soldiers. The Texas troops forced the Germans to concede a primary stronghold, which proved to be a critical step in winning the war.\n \nA month later, on November 11, 1918, Germany signed an armistice ending the Great War, and ever since we have commemorated our veterans on this day.\n \nEach person who serves in the Armed Forces deserves our utmost gratitude – they pledge their lives so that we might remain free. Today we honor them.\n \nTexans have always been proud of our troops who, like those who charged the dark forest of Blanc Mont Ridge, defend liberty in the most harrowing circumstances.\n \nJust shy of a century since that most fateful night, the men and women of Texas continue to serve with great courage and commitment.\n \nNinety Texans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the United States’ highest recognition of personal bravery. Thousands have volunteered to defend our nation since 9-11, and hundreds have given their lives in the war against terrorism. In the past year, over 17,500 Texans have joined the Armed Forces. With over 200,000 active duty personnel, reservists, National Guardsmen, and civilians at 15 military institutions across the state, Texans play a critical role in keeping Americans safe and free.\n \nToday, service members from Dyess Air Force base are conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets. ISIS is the face of evil. It is persecuting Christians. It is beheading children. It is pillaging towns. And Dyess Air Force base is playing a critical role in exterminating this evil.\n \nToday, troops from Fort Bliss and Fort Hood are deploying to Africa and fighting the spread of what Texans have unfortunately already witnessed to be the deadly disease of Ebola. These soldiers are going into the thick of the epidemic and risking their own wellbeing to end this outbreak. We are grateful for their swift response.\n \nToday, the Texas National Guard has stepped up to secure the border and protect citizens from dangerous illegal criminals that only perpetuate the humanitarian crisis on the border. They are on the front lines of saving lives on American soil. In one case, just over a month ago, three National Guard soldiers rescued a Texan who was injured along the river. He was bleeding profusely, but with their swift response, he survived and has recovered.\n \nToday, bases from Shepperd to Goodfellow to Camp Bullis train our next generation of pilots, medics, and ground troops. Bases scattered throughout the state ensure that the future of our military is strong, and that the young men and women who pledge their lives to defend this nation are well-trained and equipped. These training programs provide them a future of service and opportunity, and in turn, these young soldiers safeguard our national security interests.\n \nToday we recognize a life-long Texan, Richard Overton, who at 108 is the oldest living American World War Two veteran – we thank him for his continued patriotism.\n \nThese are only a handful of examples highlighting the robust military presence in the Lone Star State. There are countless told and untold stories of the heroes in the state. Let us never forget to tell them.\n \nThis spirit of courage lives on in Texas, and it is with grateful hearts that today we say thank you to all the men and women who have served our country.

All it has is power—power to arrest and torture, with or without laws,” as the survivor of the Soviet gulag Alexander Solzhehitsyn wrote.\n \nIt was a brutal campaign, and it almost worked.  More than 100 million people lost their lives in less than a century.  Untold numbers slaved away in work camps under horrific conditions.  From Latin America to Africa to southeast Asia, supporters of Communism were on the march.  The Soviets seemed so powerful that the only option for America and our allies seemed to be to reach some sort of accommodation with them. \n \nBut then a new American president charted a different course.  He proposed a simple paradigm of “We win, they lose.” In 1987, Ronald Reagan stood in front of the grim barrier that had been erected in 1961 to forcibly contain the freedom represented by West Berlin and demanded its removal, “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization…Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” With his allies, those tireless advocates for religious and economic freedom Pope John Paul II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, President Reagan refused to accept the tyranny of Communism as inevitable.\n \nLess than a year after Ronald Reagan left office, his vision became a reality.  No wall could hold back the waves of protest that swept from the Baltic through eastern Europe.  On November 9, 1989, freedom prevailed. Where once armed guards and barbed wire kept terrified citizens under Soviet control, a peaceful nation, a friend of the United States, began to flourish.\n \nIt might be tempting to imagine of this trajectory as part of a preordained evolution towards liberal democracy and conclude that the bad old days of the Soviet Union are a thing of the past.  But the events of the last year have demonstrated that this is very far from the truth.  Evil may have been defeated in Berlin twenty-five years ago, but it was not eradicated.  An aggressive Russia is once again massing in the region, threatening to extinguish the hard-fought gains of the millions of people whose most cherished dream was to live in freedom.    \n \nSo rather than greeting this anniversary with self-congratulatory complacency, a renewed resolve is called for.  We must resolve to remain vigilant against all those who threaten our liberties. We must resolve to embrace the opportunities those freedoms provide so America continues to set a shining example of what a truly free people can achieve.  We must resolve to encourage those yearning to be free to join us and our allies as we work to create a more stable and prosperous world.  For if we stand strong today – and every day – we may celebrate even more remarkable victories for freedom twenty-five years from now.","2014-11-09 16:07:32+00","315496455229328_641375535974750",17],[31503,"United States Senator Mike Lee on efforts in the Senate to #StopObamasAmnesty.","2014-11-08 19:34:52+00","315496455229328_640947482684222",17],[31505,"Democrat senators who just lost their seats should not be able to confirm a new Attorney General.

By refusing to rule if the States can define marriage, the Supreme Court is abdicating its duty to uphold the Constitution. The fact that the Supreme Court Justices, without providing any explanation whatsoever, have permitted lower courts to strike down so many state marriage laws is astonishing.\n \nThis is judicial activism at its worst. The Constitution entrusts state legislatures, elected by the People, to define marriage consistent with the values and mores of their citizens.  Unelected judges should not be imposing their policy preferences to subvert the considered judgments of democratically elected legislatures.\n \nThe Supreme Court is, de facto, applying an extremely broad interpretation to the 14th Amendment without saying a word – an action that is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Because of the Court’s decision today, 11 States will likely now be forced to legalize same-sex marriage: Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. And this action paves the way for laws prohibiting same-sex marriage to be overturned in any state.\n \nIt is beyond dispute that when the 14th Amendment was adopted 146 years ago, as a necessary post-Civil War era reform, it was not imagined to also mandate same-sex marriage, but that is what the Supreme Court is implying today. The Court is making the preposterous assumption that the People of the United States somehow silently redefined marriage in 1868 when they ratified the 14th Amendment.\n \nNothing in the text, logic, structure, or original understanding of the 14th Amendment or any other constitutional provision authorizes judges to redefine marriage for the Nation. It is for the elected representatives of the People to make the laws of marriage, acting on the basis of their own constitutional authority, and protecting it, if necessary, from usurpation by the courts.\n \nMarriage is a question for the States.  That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 2024, to protect the authority of state legislatures to define marriage. And that is why, when Congress returns to session, I will be introducing a constitutional amendment to prevent the federal government or the courts from attacking or striking down state marriage laws. \n \nTraditional marriage is an institution whose integrity and vitality are critical to the health of any society.

But, sadly, a vocal and angry minority of attendees at the conference tried to shout down my expression of solidarity with Israel.\n \nThey cannot shout down the truth.  And we should not shy away from expressing the truth, even in the face of – especially in the face of – ignorance and bigotry.\n \nI told the attendees that those who hate Israel also hate America, that those who hate Jews also hate Christians, and that anyone who hates Israel and the Jewish people is not following the teachings of Christ.\n \nThese statements were met with angry boos. I went on to tell the crowd that Christians in the Middle East have no better friend than Israel. That Christians can practice their faith free of persecution in Israel.  And that ISIS, al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah, along with their state sponsors in Syria and Iran, are all part of the same cancer, murdering Christians and Jews alike.  Hate is hate, and murder is murder.\n \nI came to this event tonight to help shine a light on the tragic persecution and slaughter of Christians by ISIS and Islamic radicals throughout the Middle East.

This is unacceptable--if the threat posed by ISIS is not acute--which would be indicated by the President's long deliberation, Congress must play a key role in the debate.

Inexplicably, President Obama has not during these weeks and months developed any coherent strategy to counter these terrorists who have declared their intent to attack us and our allies, and have brutally executed two of our citizens while systematically purging ethnic minorities, including Christians, in the region.\n\nWe do not need another vague speech; we need a strategy.

We know today that there are over a hundred Americans who have joined ISIS, who have taken up arms alongside the Jihadists, along with thousands of others from the European Union. And we also know that they are trying to return to their countries of origin to carry out terrorist attacks there. We know this because on May 24, an ISIS member returned to Belgium, where he attacked innocent visitors at a Jewish museum, slaughtering four people. And it was reported today that he had been plotting an even larger attack on Paris on Bastille Day. In addition, on August 11 of this year, an accused ISIS sympathizer, Donald Ray Morgan, was arrested at JFK airport trying to reenter the United States. We know that this threat is real.\n\nThat is why I have today filed legislation, the Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014, which would amend the existing statute governing renunciation of United States citizenship to designate fighting for a hostile foreign government or foreign terrorist organization as an affirmative renunciation of citizenship. By fighting for ISIS, U.S. citizens have expressed their desire to become citizens of the Islamic State, and that cannot and will not peacefully coexist with remaining American citizens. The desire to become a citizen of a terrorist organization that has expressed a desire to wage war on the American people, has demonstrated a brutal capacity to do so, murdering American civilians on the global stage and promising to bring that Jihad home to America. We should not be facilitating their efforts by allowing fighters fighting alongside ISIS to come back to America with American passports and walk freely in our cities to carry out unspeakable acts of terror.

Ronald Reagan helped us do it in the 1980s and we can to it again now.\n\nIf the economy had recovered at the pace of Reagan’s recovery the  economy would be $2.2 trillion larger this year.  It's all because he put his faith in America's workers to make their own decisions that unleashed a new era of prosperity for the nation.\n\nPresident Obama has done the opposite and because of destructive Obama  policies, the economy has lost $6.4 trillion cumulatively since the recession ended--$20,388 per person.\n\nWe owe it to the American people to get the economy going again.

Yet the road to freedom for African Americans in this country has been too long. For years, civil rights leaders fought for their rights, and for justice, but they faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge in the Senate: a bloc of Southern Democrats who refused to support the bill.\n\nToday we remember the long and contentious debate that lasted sixty days, before Senate Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey (MN) and Republican Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen (IL) were together able to compile the votes needed to end the filibuster, pass the bill, and make it law. We remember the words of Senator Dirksen when he rose that day when the filibuster ended, urging his colleagues to drop their opposition to the bill. He recalled, ‘It is said that on the night he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, substantially this sentiment: Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come. The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing of government, in education, and in employment. It must not be stayed or denied.’\n\nNonetheless, 23 Democrats and 6 Republicans fiercely opposed ending the filibuster and taking up the landmark bill.  And yet, the remainder of the Senate – Republicans and Democrats joining together – invoked cloture and passed the bill, to ensure that all people, regardless of race, gender, or religion were treated with equality and dignity under the law. Republicans and Democrats gathered at the White House on July 2 to watch President Johnson, a Southerner from Texas, sign the bill into law, finally making good on the words of President John F. Kennedy who a year earlier called on every American to “examine his conscience” and support the bill.\n\nOur work is not over. Racial discrimination and bigotry persists, and we must be united working to defeat it. Moreover, when Dr. Martin Luther King gathered millions on the National Mall in the summer of 1963, those men and women were marching for not only their rights, but also for opportunity.\n\nWe can still do better by fighting to give everyone in our country the opportunities they deserve.  We must do better. And, if Republicans and Democrats can come together as they did in 1964 once again, we will.","2014-07-02 15:12:59+00","315496455229328_571930352919269",17],[31739,"The #HobbyLobby victory is great news, but Obamacare's assault on religious liberty continues.

As a Texan, I am particularly encouraged by our close relationship in the energy sector, which will shortly enable Israel to become an energy exporter to neighbors like Egypt and Jordan.\n \nIsrael has also become a key security partner for America in the region assisting us with everything from counter-terrorism efforts to research and development on programs such as Iron Dome and Iron Beam—and most importantly standing firmly by our side to counter the looming threat of a nuclear Iran.\n \nOn this Holocaust Remembrance Day, our best way to affirm our commitment to “never again” is to present a united front with our close friend and ally Israel, and to express our vigorous support for the Jewish state and for Jews worldwide by focusing on our clear national security interest—which is continuing to guarantee Israel’s security through our unquestionable commitment to our friendship.","2014-04-28 21:38:03+00","315496455229328_536158756496429",17],[31955,"Secretary Kerry has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to countenance a world where Israel is made a pariah because it will not sacrifice its security to his diplomatic initiatives.\n\nIt is my belief that Secretary Kerry has proven himself unsuitable for his position and that before any further harm is done to our alliance with Israel, he should offer President Obama his resignation, and the President should accept it.","2014-04-28 21:15:39+00","315496455229328_536145793164392",17],[31957,"Texas to Toyota: Come on down! #GTT","2014-04-28 14:53:40+00","315496455229328_535959269849711",17],[31959,"The systematic degradation of liberty continues in Venezuela. #SOSVenezuela","2014-04-27 17:03:40+00","315496455229328_535482483230723",17],[31961,"We need answers from BLM.","2014-04-25 20:07:28+00","315496455229328_534534093325562",17],[31963,"The contrast in this tale of two hospitals could not be more clear: Hamas exploits their medical facilities as a human shield to launch terrorist operations against Israel, while Israel uses theirs to provide cutting-edge medical care to people whose government’s avowed goal is to destroy the Jewish state. \n\nHamas‘ actions are a war crime.

America stands ready to welcome a free and peaceful Iran into a mutually-beneficial friendship.\n\nWhile Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, languishes in a brutal Iranian prison for the peaceful profession of his Christian faith, however, there should be no illusions that the regime of Hasan Rouhani is any more \"moderate\" than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The case of Pastor Saeed demonstrates the grim reality that under the genial veneer of cell phone chats and tweets, the cruelly oppressive and anti-American policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei are unchanged.\n\nPastor Saeed is, unfortunately, only one piece in the larger picture of human rights abuses in Iran.  Not only are he and his fellow Americans Amir Hekmati and Robert Levinson detained in Iran, but the regime has also increased its oppression of its own people.  Just this month, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Iran submitted a report detailing how the human rights crisis has worsened--not improved--since Rouhani's election, including spikes in executions and abuses of religious freedom.\n\nSome in the Obama administration believe human rights issues can be compartmentalized, or rather marginalized, in their quest to get a comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear program, and the administration has shown little interest in officially naming Iranian human rights abusers for sanctions.  I believe this is a mistake, and that we should be aggressively pursuing human rights abusers in Iran as we should in Russia.

To hear Putin tell it in his address to the Duma, this action is not only perfectly legal, it also rights a historical wrong in which Russia was “robbed” of its rightful claim to the Crimean peninsula in 1954.\n\nPresident Obama has disputed the legality of these actions, observing that “President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations, but I don’t think that’s fooling anyone.” The reality, however, is that Putin is not concerned with international law or historical justice.  His sole focus is on correcting what he considers to be the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century” by reassembling the Soviet Union.   Ukraine is only a step in this process.  That is the real challenge the United States has to face, which we cannot do when we are agonizing over what our respective legal teams think.\n\nThere is an historical model we can consult for guidance in this crisis, as deterring Soviet aggression without engaging in military conflict was exactly what President Ronald Reagan had in mind when he proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative thirty-one years ago next Sunday.\n\nThe genius of SDI was that it did not recklessly attack the Soviets but rather neutralized their threat through our technological advantage.  Derided as a “Star Wars” style fantasy that was impossible to realize, President Reagan’s vision was a major component in the effort that brought down the Soviet Union without firing a shot, as no one ever started a war with a weapon called missile defense.\n\nThe Obama administration has unfortunately shown little enthusiasm for missile defense, beginning with the decision to cancel plans for a ballistic missile defense system in Central Europe, announced on the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 2009.  This pattern continued with the arbitrary and unnecessary concessions made to the Russians limiting our global deployment of missile defense in the New START that was implemented in 2011 and remains in force until 2021.\n\nMost recently, on March 14th the Government Accountability Office released a report titled “Regional Missile Defense: DOD’s Report Provided Limited Information; Assessment of Acquisition Risks is Optimistic.” It provides the depressing assessment that what missile defense programs we still have planned in Europe are going to be delayed to the tune of years because of technological glitches and cost overruns—a failure that would not have been tolerated if missile defense was a priority for the Commander in Chief.\n\nThis report could not have come at a more inopportune time, but perhaps it can serve as a wake-up call that President Obama’s policies on both Russia and missile defense have collapsed and should be immediately reversed through the following actions:\n\n1) The President should begin the process of withdrawing from New START according to the provision of Article XIV(3) of the Treaty, which declares “Each party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests;”\n\n2) The Secretary of Defense should engage in a full re-assessment of our missile defense posture in Europe with the purpose of restoring or expanding the installations cancelled in 2009; and\n\n3) The Secretary of Defense should, in conjunction with this work, engage in a thorough review of the delays and costs over-runs of the existing missile defense programs for Europe with the goal of accelerating their scheduled implementation.\n\nThese simple steps would send a clear and unequivocal signal to Vladimir Putin that the United States is unafraid to stand with our allies for our own national security interests.\n\nToday his sights are set on Ukraine, but if he continues undeterred tomorrow it could be Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Romania, the Czech Republic, or Poland.  Meeting his challenge now with strength, not appeasement, would be the best way to ensure that this does not happen, and that we do not squander our hard-won Cold War victory over the Soviets.","2014-03-19 17:37:36+00","315496455229328_10104332518340390",17],[32100,"Higher health care premiums on the way thanks to the \"Affordable Care Act.\" #FullRepeal","2014-03-19 12:21:42+00","315496455229328_10104331709196920",17],[32104,"Putin’s aggressiveness against Ukraine is a direct product of the lack of leadership of the United States over the last five years.","2014-03-18 22:16:50+00","315496455229328_10104329960431460",17],[32105,"\"Texas once again is leading the nation in job growth ... and economists say trends for the rest of the year look promising.\" #MakeDCListen","2014-03-18 12:44:51+00","315496455229328_10104328330572710",17],[32107,"As dire as things appear, I’m encouraged because people are waking up.

Activists have been detained and abused, and even shot dead in the streets. Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has emerged as a powerful voice for economic and political freedom, has been arrested and faces the summary judgment of a makeshift kangaroo court. But the perseverance of the protestors in the face of these thuggish tactics suggests there are still many who do not accept the failed socialist policies of Hugo Chavez and his hand-picked successor as inevitable. Venezuela can and should be free and prosperous, not suffering under the withering blight of violent crime, rampant inflation and shortages of basic necessities—not to mention close allegiances to Iran and Cuba.\n\nA year ago when Chavez died and Maduro became president in a highly-questionable election, the Obama administration missed an opportunity to support the opposition by encouraging the Organization of American States to step in and supervise a recount, opting instead for the illusory stability of the status quo. We should not miss another such opportunity to support those who would be our friends in Venezuela, and we should urge the OAS to dispatch a delegation to investigate the alleged human rights abuses of Maduro’s regime. We should press vigorously for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Lopez. And we should make it clear that the United States stands with those who are fighting for a brighter future in Venezuela.","2014-02-21 17:37:24+00","315496455229328_10104238383657050",17],[32201,"Thoughts and prayers for the friends, family, and loved ones of Texans caught up in the chaos in Ukraine:","2014-02-20 18:06:38+00","315496455229328_10104235005656590",17],[32166,"The situation unfolding in Ukraine right now is a harsh lesson that no matter how great the victory, we must never rest on our laurels. After the United States won the Cold War and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991, many on both sides of the aisle believed that the Soviet threat to freedom was a thing of the past and that the new, democratic Russia would be a reasonable partner and even an ally.\n \nThe events of the last seventy-two hours demonstrate this is not case. Vladimir Putin barely waited for the flame of the Olympic torch in Sochi to be extinguished before he turned his attention to crushing the most recent attempt of the Ukrainian people to move towards freedom and the West. Despite warnings and expressions of concern from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Advisor, the Ambassador to the United Nations and even the President of the United States, Putin apparently feels he can act with impunity in what he considers to be his exclusive sphere of influence.\n \nHe has good reason to do so. Over the five years of his presidency, President Obama has done nothing to help the people of Georgia reclaim the some 20 percent of their sovereign territory that was violated by the 2008 Russian invasion, instead instructing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to attempt to “reset” the relationship with Russia in the hopes of pursuing more arms control agreements rather than forcefully defending American national security interests, and those of our allies. \n \nThis evening, President Obama spoke about his deep concerns about reports of Russian military action in Ukraine, and urged Putin not to violate international laws. But as the President and his national security team are apparently the last to learn, Putin has scant regard for international norms when they run counter to his goal of re-establishing Soviet-style regional hegemony over unfortunate states like Georgia and Ukraine who have the temerity to want a more free, prosperous future for their people. And Putin is under no illusions that the President’s vague threats mean any more than his infamous ‘red line’ in the Syrian desert.\n \nIf we were serious about standing up to Putin’s power grab, we would immediately suspend Russian membership in the Group of Eight (G-8), which should consist of nations that can contribute to a civilized order. And if the Russians persist in this aggressive action, we should look into additional measures such as suspension from the World Trade Organization and even the United Nations Security Council.\n \nThe United States stands with Ukraine.","2014-03-01 00:44:57+00","315496455229328_506662359446069",17],[32167,"I am absolutely convinced we are going to repeal every single word of Obamacare. \n\nLIKE if you are too! #FullRepeal","2014-02-28 21:58:29+00","315496455229328_10104264966060700",17],[32168,"Luckily for these elementary students, this reading of Green Eggs and Ham didn't come with a 21 hour speech!","2014-02-28 15:31:02+00","315496455229328_506496049462700",17],[32171,"It is the singular honor of my life to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with each of you and fight to #MakeDCListen.","2014-02-27 22:44:21+00","315496455229328_10104261295890750",17],[32174,"Over 100,000 Americans have made their voices heard on proposed rules to allow the #IRS to stifle political speech.

Deplorable violence against the peaceful protests of Yanukovych’s unilateral decision to reject a popular trade agreement with the European Union and instead embrace closer ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia has already occurred on November 30, December 1 and December 11, 2013. Now this grim pattern is repeating itself. \n\nThe United States must not turn a blind eye to the struggle for freedom in a country where we have such a clear strategic interest. Putin’s proposed Eurasian Customs Union, of which Ukraine would be a cornerstone, is a thinly veiled attempt to re-assimilate the territory of \"greater Russia\" that made up the old Soviet Union. His offer of economic assistance is a first step in binding Ukraine to this new bloc. Given Ukraine’s economic and security significance to both the U.S. and our NATO allies in western Europe it would be a mistake to allow this expansion of Russia’s sphere of interest, especially given the tenacity with which Ukrainians have fought against it in recent months. \n\nThe President and Congress should unite in a coherent and sustained program to support the opposition and encourage Yanukovych to both rescind his restrictions on the rights of the Ukrainian people and renounce violence against those engaged in protest. I was pleased to co-sponsor Senate Resolution 319 introduced by Senator Chris Murphy on December 12, 2013, which includes the important clause: “in the event of further state violence against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress should consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against individuals responsible for ordering or carrying out the violence.” The Department of State should be commended for implementing visa bans against Ukrainian officials this week. We should follow-up swiftly with targeted economic sanctions as well, including freezing the assets of those responsible for the violence. \n\nThe people of Ukraine should know that the United States stands with them during this difficult time.","2014-01-23 23:13:58+00","315496455229328_10104128166902310",17],[32322,"Will the President act to ensure that the privacy of law-abiding citizens is protected from unjustifiable violations by arms of the federal government such as the NSA, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Health and Human Services?","2014-01-23 19:03:38+00","315496455229328_10104127456286390",17],[32323,"The IRS should not be targeting the political free speech of American citizens.

The United States must lead the international community to ensure the most dangerous regime in the world does not possess the world’s most dangerous weapon.\n\nI am pleased to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues on this resolution outlining a comprehensive deal with Iran that, if properly implemented, would represent a material degradation of Iran’s nuclear activities. The resolution also raises the important issue of Iran’s ballistic missile program, which is designed to deliver a nuclear weapon to the western hemisphere including the United States—an issue that is lamentably absent from the November 24, 2013, Joint Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear program. Majority Leader Harry Reid should listen to the thirteen members of his own caucus who have co-sponsored this Resolution and allow a vote on it before the end of the year.\n\nGiven the profound deficiencies in the deal reached in Geneva last month that this Resolution does not fully address, I am hopeful that Congress will also take additional action to curb Iran’s progress towards a nuclear weapon. Almost a month has passed since the JPA was agreed upon, and the timeline laid out in it has not even begun. We should consider at the very least making the six-month duration of the deal retroactive to November 24th, 2013 so that the Iranians do not take advantage of the ongoing negotiations to gain time.\n\nWe should also consider instructing the Treasury Department to increase its efforts to designate Iranian individuals and companies associated with that nation’s nuclear program and proliferation of WMD activities overseen by the IRGC (“Revolutionary Guard”) who are using deceptive practices to evade economic sanctions. Such action is in accordance with the current sanctions program; it is not affected by the JPA, and it would reduce the economic benefits the Iranian regime will enjoy from this interim agreement.\n\nThe Obama Administration has insisted the Geneva deal is an important opportunity to reach a greater rapprochement with Iran that will result in a comprehensive agreement regarding their nuclear program, and that any additional efforts at sanctions are “gratuitous” for its duration. Unfortunately, Iranian actions since November 24, 2013, including their temporarily walking out of negotiations in response to the United State enforcing existing sanctions not covered in the Geneva deal and the recent public declaration by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif that Iran retains the ability to resume uranium enrichment at a 20% level within 24 hours, are not encouraging, to say the least.\n\nIf this pattern continues, Congress should consider immediately suspending the proposed relaxation of sanctions under the JPA unless and until Iran actually halts its nuclear program. We should not be so naïve as to allow billions of additional dollars to flow into Iran while it is flouting its international commitments and actively pursuing nuclear weapons, to the detriment of our vital national security interests.","2013-12-20 14:59:50+00","315496455229328_474493205996318",17],[32412,"Charles Krauthammer hits the nail on the head.

Such abuse was inevitable after this American citizen, whose only crime is the peaceful practice of his Christian faith, was transferred to Iran’s equivalent of death row—not coincidentally on the 34th anniversary of the hostage crisis in Tehran, a day celebrated by Iranians as 'Death to America Day.'\n\nIt is unconscionable that senior American diplomats, including the Secretary of State, who were conducting cordial negotiations with their Iranian counterparts in Geneva in the days after Pastor Saeed’s transfer, could not bring themselves to even mention his name, or those of fellow Americans detained in Iran, Amir Hekmati and Robert Levinson. We are informed by administration officials that the issue of the American prisoners is 'on the margins' of more important diplomatic work, and that in any event, President Obama mentioned Abedini and Hekmati to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani when they spoke by telephone in September.\n\nThe President’s action should not have been an end unto itself but rather the first step in a sustained effort to get these men home. Their unconditional release should be central, not peripheral, to any further agreement with Iran. If the United States was prepared to release an Iranian nuclear scientist, Mojtaba Atarodi, as a good faith gesture paving the way to direct negotiations between our two nations for the first time in more than thirty years, the Iranians should have been required to do at least as much. We should have told them up front that their detention of our citizens and hostile rhetoric against the United States and our ally Israel is unacceptable, rather than engaging, without preconditions, in a negotiation that will provide the Iranian regime substantial sanction relief while doing nothing to curb—let alone end—its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\n\nA recent Pew poll reveals that American’s confidence in our position in the world is at an all-time low.

General John J. Pershing eloquently expressed his thanks in a letter to the troops who helped win the “war to end all wars,” that is just as relevant now as it was then.\n\nPershing wrote, “By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor, strength and indomitable will, made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation, you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.”\n\nWe are so fortunate that throughout history, millions of Americans have come forward to fight tyrants, fascists, communists, and terrorists to keep us free.\n\nStill, we live in a violent world, where the freedoms we enjoy remain exceptional to millions of less fortunate forced to abide by brutal dictators, oppressive regimes, and cultures of intolerance.\n\nThe persistent threats of terrorism at home and abroad are reminders of how precious it is to be an American and how fiercely our rights must be protected.\n\nWe are blessed to live in a society where men and women continue to fight for our flag. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, more than 3 million Americans have volunteered to defend their country, knowing full well the risks they may face. More than 50,000 are serving in Afghanistan right now.\n\nThey, like millions of veterans before them, are willingly putting themselves in danger to keep us safe.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge once said, “The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.” He was right.\n\nPlease join me on this Veterans Day in saying a prayer of thanks for our veterans. And, please find a veteran. Grab their hand. Look them in the eye and tell them, “Thank you for your service.”\n\nWe will never be able to express enough thanks for the troops, but they must always know they are treasured.\n\nMay God bless the veterans, may God bless all those who continue to protect our country, and may God bless the United States of America.","2013-11-11 16:54:18+00","315496455229328_457540927691546",17],[32536,"Wishing a very happy birthday to the United States Marine Corps.

Pastor Saeed’s cruel imprisonment for peacefully practicing his Christian faith has gone on for more than a year. During this time it has been inspirational to see the courage and faith professed by his wife Naghmeh, and to hear her account of how, even under such duress, Pastor Saeed has continued his ministry and converted as many as thirty of his fellow prisoners at Evin.\n\nPastor Saeed’s situation has, however, now reached a crisis point. The prison at Karaj houses violent criminals on death row, and is infamous for the abuse of political prisoners. One international observer reported in 2005 that “Going to Karaj is a severe punishment. Once in there one stops to be a human being.” Conditions have not improved since then. Our first priority has to be to get Pastor Saeed out of these terrible circumstances. The International Red Cross should be granted access to him, and he should be promptly liberated.\n\nBut once the immediate danger to Pastor Saeed is relieved, the larger issue is that such human rights outrages have no place in the civilized exchange between nations. Many Americans have been hopeful in recent months that the new president of Iran, Hasan Rouhani, would be a more moderate partner and work with the United States to peacefully resolve the international crisis over Iran’s nuclear program. Indeed, historic bi-lateral negotiations are slated to resume in Geneva later this week based on the perception that there has been a material improvement in Iran’s historically hostile posture towards the United States and our allies.\n\nUnfortunately, this harsh persecution of an American – made, not coincidentally, on the 34th anniversary of the illegal seizure of American hostages in Iran – could hardly be more clearly designed to send the opposite message. It is difficult to see how the Obama administration can engage in good-faith talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran under these circumstances.\n\nPresident Obama should be commended for raising the issue of Pastor Saeed’s release in his telephone call with President Rouhani on September 27th. Given this recent action, I hope President Obama now takes that request one step further and demands his release as a precondition to any further negotiations. The Iranians should not be allowed to try to leverage Pastor Saeed’s his release into American concessions over sanctions. Rather, the President should make it clear that it is incumbent on the Iranians to demonstrate through this action that the rhetoric of their new president is more than mere lip service to gain economic relief. I am sure all my colleagues who value religious freedom would be proud to stand with the President in this effort.\n\nIt is time for Iran to stop the chants of ‘Death to America’ and start freeing the many prisoners of conscience suffering in unjust captivity in that country, starting with Saeed Abedini.","2013-11-05 22:34:59+00","315496455229328_454286301350342",17],[32563,"\"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.

Most are ending policies sold after the law passed in March 2010. At least a few are cancelling plans sold to people with pre-existing medical conditions.”\n\nPresident Obama is sure to promise Americans that with more time, taxpayer money, and patience the law will perform better. Its failings, however, are not limited to its website or its rollout.\n\nWe already know Obamacare can’t live up to its promises. President Obama promised Americans that their premiums would go down, taxes would stay low, millions of jobs would be created, and if they liked their healthcare plans, they could keep them. Instead, premiums are rising, taxes are higher, the economy is sputtering, and people are losing their plans.\n\nObamacare is the nation’s biggest job killer and stands in the way of our country’s economic growth and prosperity. It should be defunded and repealed. President Obama should hear the pleas from the untold number of Americans who are losing their jobs, wages, and healthcare plans, and Congress should act immediately to stop Obamacare from inflicting any more damage on the country on our hard-working citizens.","2013-10-21 15:34:52+00","315496455229328_446005165511789",17],[32644,"SHARE if you agree! #MakeDCListen","2013-10-21 15:00:46+00","315496455229328_445992892179683",17],[32646,"Whether it is East Texas, West Texas, the panhandle or down in the Valley, Obamacare is a job killer. #MakeDCListen","2013-10-20 01:28:21+00","315496455229328_445332538912385",17],[32648,"Like your health care plan and want to keep it?

Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats to fully fund Obamacare was yet the latest example of Washington not listening to the people.\n\nObamacare is a 'train wreck,' a 'nightmare,' to use the words of its Democratic author and a union leader who previously supported the bill. It is the biggest job killer in America.\n\nAs Teamsters President James Hoffa explained in a letter to Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Obamacare is hurting 'millions of working men and women ... and the families they support,' and it 'will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.'\n\nSenate Democrats refused to listen.\n\nPresident Obama has granted exemptions for big business and Members of Congress, but Senate Democrats refuse to grant the American people the same exemption. Instead, they used political power to maintain their privileged position while doing nothing to respond to the pleas of millions of Americans.\n\nBut this fight continues. Now the bill returns to the House. The House showed remarkable courage voting to defund Obamacare, and I hope and believe that the House will stand by their resolve and continue to lead the effort to stop the Obamacare train wreck.\n\nObamacare is killing jobs, forcing people into part-time work, causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket, and threatening the healthcare of millions of Americans.\n\nToday, far too many Republicans joined Harry Reid in giving the Democrats the ability to fund Obamacare. When the bill comes back to the Senate, when the House yet again stands for principle and fights for the American people, I very much hope that Senate Republicans will rise to the challenge. We are stronger when we are united, and we can defeat Obamacare only if Senate Republicans come together, stand with House Republicans, and champion the millions of Americans being harmed by this disastrous healthcare law.\n\n#MakeDCListen","2013-09-27 17:49:28+00","315496455229328_432484376863868",17],[32781,"A yes vote on cloture today is a vote with Harry Reid to allow him to fund Obamacare #DefundObamacare #MakeDCListen #DontBlink","2013-09-27 14:23:43+00","315496455229328_432408240204815",17],[32783,"Harry Reid and Senate Democrats will vote yes on cloture tomorrow.

He took particular issue with the end of the President’s statement:\n\n“But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That’s what makes America different. That’s what makes us exceptional.“\n\nMr. Putin worries that it is “extremely dangerous” for the President to encourage the Americans to see themselves as exceptional. His concern is well placed. Historically it has not boded well for autocrats when Americans are clearly focused on the values and principles that have made our nation great:\n\nWhen millions of men, women and children were being systematically gassed in Nazi concentration camps, Americans fought to end the slaughter, with 405,399 of our “greatest generation” sacrificing their lives to defeat Fascism.\n\nWhen millions of men, women, and children were being brutalized in Soviet gulags, Americans on both sides of the political aisle rallied together to fight the Cold War. After decades of struggle, the Iron Curtain crumbled and 286,730,819 people were freed from the yoke of Communism.\n\nBoth of these efforts, which not coincidentally were also firmly in the national security interests of the United States, were the two greatest acts of liberation in the history of the planet.\n\nEven at the risk of discomfiting Mr. Putin further, I hope President Obama amplifies his remarks on American exceptionalism as we engage in the ongoing debate on Syria. We live in a great country where citizens can criticize their President and not fear a visit from the secret police. As Americans we can agree that to disagree over weighty issues and still stand united in the defense of freedom.

To date I have heard a great deal from the administration about punishing Bashir al-Assad for violating an “international norm” through the use of chemical weapons, and that this is why we must act against him. Abstract notions about international norms should never displace U.S. sovereignty to act, or refuse to act, for our national security.\n\nAssad’s murderous actions have claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand of his own people, which is a humanitarian tragedy. But our chief strategic concern should not be international norms; it should be preventing the chemical weapons from falling into the hands of al Qaeda or other terrorists who might use them against us and our allies.\n\nIt is now incumbent upon President Obama to make his case and persuade Congress that his plan is necessary, and the best course to preserve our security and protect our liberties.

In Great Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has called the House of Commons home from vacation to deliberate over the use of force in Syria. In Israel, the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is reviewing potential responses should Israel be attacked in the fallout over action in Syria.\n\nIn Washington, DC, crickets are chirping.\n\nIt may be that there is a compelling case to be made that intervention in Syria is necessary to defend U.S. interests. But to date no such case has been made by President Obama, leaving those of us in Congress with some serious questions.\n\nThe President has in the past insisted that Assad must go, but this week his press secretary insisted that regime change is not part of any planned action in Syria. Given this lack of strategic consistency, Congress has every right to ask what the basic purpose of this action would be? On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed certainty that the Assad regime was responsible for the attack, but today we are learning there are outstanding questions about who actually ordered it and who controls the weapons. Given this confusion, Congress has every right to ask what the basis is for action at this time? In a press interview yesterday, the President said that the “very limited” action he is considering “may have a positive impact on our national security.” Given this modest mandate and uncertain outcome, Congress has every right to ask why we are considering this action at all?\n\nAccording to the Constitution, only Congress has the authority to declare war. While the Commander in Chief must have the flexibility to act in the event of an imminent threat, the President's comments suggest this does not currently exist in Syria. There is time for debate, and no more important subject for Congress to consider. Deploying our armed forces is a serious commitment of the highest order, and we should only consider it in cases where our vital national security interests are at stake. Our allies have demonstrated a willingness to do proper due diligence on this issue. We owe it to the men and women in our armed forces, who would execute this mission, to do no less. When and if President Obama makes a decision on Syria, he must immediately call a special session of Congress and persuade the American people that what he proposes is critical to the defense of our nation.

There’s no more important job than being a father, and a strong, loving Dad gives every child the foundation he or she needs to brave this world. \r\n\r\nMy own Dad has been my hero my entire life. He is a man of faith and deep integrity, a man who loves liberty with all his heart. His truly American story of fleeing oppression in Cuba with nothing more than $100 to his name and finding success through hard work and perserverence has inspired me my entire life. Today, my Dad is a pastor, and through his life I have seen every day his love and faith in Jesus. Each Dad should endeavor to reflect our heavenly Father’s love for us, and my Dad has done that throughout my life.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, I became a Dad myself, and I learned firsthand just how strong a father’s love could be. There is nothing I would not do for my two daughters. I continue to fight each and every day to preserve this Shining City on a Hill for them–-working to ensure that my girls inherit the same blessed land of liberty and opportunity that each of us has been so priviliged to enjoy–is what keeps me going. For the first time in American history, our children are facing growing up in a country that may well be worse off than it was for the previous generation. This is completely and utterly unacceptable; we cannot selfishly spend away the futures of our children.

After I won my titles, I wasn’t content putting them on the shelf and walking away. I wanted to inspire others to join me in my fitness crusade.\n\nWhen I began my career, if you asked someone where the nearest gym was, they would most likely look at you like you were a serial killer. If you were lucky, they would point you to some faraway dungeon with a few barbells and some weights.\n\nToday, it’s hard to find a strip mall or a building without a fitness center, and for the most part, you would never mistake a modern gym for a torture chamber. We’ve come a long way, but I know this is not a crusade that has an obvious end point. We will always have to keep pushing forward and fighting to show people the benefits of health.\n\nI met Adam and Roman because they share my commitment to health and fitness. When I decided to get back into the fitness game, I sought out the best and brightest experts in the field. In that search, I asked everyone from my fans to my advisors who they recommended I look at. Without fail, the names Romaniello and Bornstein kept floating to the top...\"","2013-04-16 23:30:34+00","9269711759_10151546243556760",16],[30260,"Get ready for some serious workout knowledge from Bandana Training","2013-04-12 00:59:43+00","9269711759_564326523601692",16],[30262,"So you want to talk about intensity?

Joe Weider was a titan in the fitness industry and one of the kindest men I have ever met.\r\n\r\nI knew about Joe Weider long before I met him - he was the godfather of fitness who told all of us to \"Be Somebody with a Body.\" He taught us that through hard work and training we could all be champions.  When I was a young boy in Austria, his muscle magazines provided me with the inspiration and the blueprint to push myself beyond my limits and imagine a much bigger future. I know that countless others around the world found motivation in the pages of his publications just as I did, but as I read his articles in Austria, I felt that he was speaking directly to me and I committed to move to America to make my vision of becoming the best bodybuilder, to live the American dream, and to become an actor a reality.\r\n\r\nJoe didn’t just inspire my earliest dreams; he made them come true the day he invited me to move to America to pursue my bodybuilding career. I will never forget his generosity. One of Joe’s greatest qualities is that he wasn’t just generous with his money; he freely gave of his time and expertise and became a father figure for me. He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in \"Hercules in New York\", even though I barely spoke English. As my career took off, he was always nearby, giving advice, promoting my movies or my crusade as the Chairman of the President's Council on Fitness in the pages of his magazines, and appearing at my fundraisers and events when I decided to run for Governor. He was there for me constantly throughout my life, and I will miss him dearly.\r\n\r\nHe leaves behind a fantastic legacy of a fitter world. Very few people can claim to have influenced as many lives as Joe did through his magazines, his supplements, his training equipment, and his big-hearted personality. Joe was known for urging everyone, “Exceed yourself,” and there is no question that throughout his life, he did just that.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts and prayers are with his extraordinary wife, the love of his life, Betty, and all of his family and friends.","2013-03-23 18:11:59+00","9269711759_10151510122966760",16],[30275,"Proud of our first @Regions20 project in China to provide 100% of the hospital water heating needs w/ solar power.","2013-03-21 23:56:43+00","9269711759_10151507566616760",16],[30277,"Read this.

How can you watch this and make any excuse not to train, to better yourself, to keep moving forward?\n\nBut there's more. They remind all of us that fitness is our right.\n\nWe all have the right to be physically fit. Young, old, injured, healthy, rich, poor, it doesn't matter. Regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, and everything else, we all share this human body. We may look different outwardly, but we are made of the same things. \n\nSo I'd challenge everyone in our fitness movement: what are YOU doing to ensure that EVERYONE can access a fitter and healthier life? What are you doing for six year-olds like Daniel, who I met last week through Make-A-Wish and became serious about training when he recovered from chemo? What are you doing for athletes like the ones in this video to make your gym accessible? What are you doing to open your arms to everyone?\n\nFitness is a right, and I hope you're inspired by this video not only to better yourself, but to improve our fitness crusade, to be inclusive, to reach out and inspire.\n\nFor more info on Team Some Assembly Required:\n\nwww.teamsomeassemblyrequired.com\n#TeamSomeAssemblyRequired \n#TeamSAR #SARNation","2016-03-08 22:37:23+00","9269711759_10153844561186760",16],[29593,"I love Snapchat.

For Todd.\n\nI can tell you that I’ve talked to Todd twice now, and the feeling is like nothing else. I am not exaggerating when I call him my hero. The feeling after our talks is better than winning my first Mr. Universe. It’s definitely better than a red carpet.\n\nEach of you has that power. It might be someone struggling to buy their groceries in front of you in line. It might be an older person that needs help carrying their gifts. How many kids are spending the holidays in the hospital and would light up if you brought a gift—or even just read a book to them? Every day, we have these chances, and it’s easy to miss them when we are looking down at our machines. This week, let’s not let the opportunities pass.\n\nEven if you’re the Grinch, do it for selfish reasons. I learned a long time ago that giving back is the most addicting feeling in the world. It’s why I worked with Special Olympics, visited every state when I was the Chairman of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and founded After-School All-Stars more than two decades ago.\n\nIt doesn’t take money or fame or a grand gesture. It just takes a little time and thought. And we all benefit. I know when I heard that another redditor had sent Todd a t-shirt, it brightened my day.\n\nEnough talk. Just do it. Then come here and share so we can inspire more people. For Todd. Or as you kids say, #ForTodd.\n\nBut really, for all of us.

Jack was literally an apostle for fitness, and his gospel inspired billions all over the world to live healthier lives.\n\nFrom the moment I met Jack on Venice Beach in 1968, I knew I'd never meet someone with so much energy – to keep himself in the best shape imaginable, but also to motivate everyone around him to get moving, eat well, and be the best version of themselves. He was on a mission to make a healthier world, and he wouldn't be content until he'd touched every person he could. He did just that, through his fantastic television shows, his innovative products, and his contagious spirit. He was so adamant about fitness that it was never about just himself and being the fittest man in the world, it was always about how he could make everyone else join him. In fact, I'm sure I'm not alone in still using my Jack LaLanne Power Juicer every day. \n\nAbove all else, Jack was a man of action. When asked to work on the President's Council for Physical Fitness, he dove into action. When he wanted to find a way to get people eating more fruits and vegetables, he just invented an easier way to put 12 carrots into one cup of juice. When you asked him to research food supplements, he started poring over the science that very second. When I called on him to work on my Governor's Council on Physical Fitness, it didn't matter how old he was, he showed up for duty right away. Whenever I or anyone else needed any help to promote fitness he was there. I remember one time I was on a plane with him – he was 92 at the time – and he said \"I'm so stiff, I've got to stretch my hamstrings.\" And he reached his legs right up to the ceiling of the plane. He was 92! Right away, I thought, \"Jack isn't just stretching, he is inspiring the rest of us.\" Believe me, I didn't miss a set in my workout that evening. And that's what he did for the entire world throughout all of his 96 years.\n\nNow Jack, for so long the most energetic man in the room, can finally rest, knowing that he left the world a better and fitter place than he found it. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jack's wife Elaine and his entire family during this difficult time.","2011-01-24 19:51:32+00","9269711759_10150125512206760",16],[30677,"Emergency on a Plane: The Sequel.
