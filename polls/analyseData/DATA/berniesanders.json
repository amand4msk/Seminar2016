This decision hinges on the absurd notion that money is speech, that corporations are people, and that giving huge piles of cash in support of politicians in exchange for influence does not constitute corruption.\n\nIn essence, this ruling handed millionaires and billionaires — who have already rigged our economy — unlimited influence in our elections. It gave billionaires like the Koch Brothers an even bigger opportunity to purchase the House, the Senate, even the White House.\n\nSuper PACs — a direct outgrowth of the Citizens United decision — are enabling the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in this country to spend unlimited amounts on elections.\n\nWe know, for example, that the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, want to use the Citizens United decision to buy politicians across the country. This election cycle alone, they have committed to spend at least $750 million on political activities — an outrageous sum that is corrupting our political process. And I can assure you, brothers and sisters, they won’t be spending that money with the interests of working families, women, and seniors in mind. That is simply unacceptable, and it’s time for the American people to rise up and reclaim our democracy.\n\nLet’s be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are talking about a rapid movement in this country towards a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who gets elected or who does not get elected. That is not what this country is supposed to be about. That was not Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n\nThe need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue.

But even assuming that payroll tax increase would be paid for by workers, calling it a “9 percent tax hike” leaves out the savings average workers would get from a single-payer system. Because single payer would be far cheaper than today's private-insurance system, average workers would still come out far ahead of where they are today.\n\nWhat really concerns me about Hillary’s tactic here is that this kind of faux analysis makes it harder for any future president – including Hillary Clinton herself, if she’s elected – to propose a single-payer healthcare system.\"","2015-11-17 21:50:44+00","124955570892789_931304673591204",9],[10704,"Every American has been appalled and disgusted by the attack against the people of Paris by the terrorist organization ISIS.

Now is the time – as President Obama is trying to do – to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world. But let me also say that now is not the time for demagoguery and fear mongering. What terrorism is about is trying to instill terror and fear into the hearts of people. And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear. During these difficult times, we will not succumb to Islamophobia. We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. We will do what we do best and that is be Americans – fighting racism, fighting xenophobia, fighting fear.\n\nWell, in 2002 we had a president, George W.

Please spread the truth:\n\n(1) Bernie’s proposals would cost less than what we’d spend without them. Most of the “cost” the Journal comes up with—$15 trillion—would pay for opening Medicare to everyone. This would be cheaper than relying on our current system of for-profit private health insurers that charge you and me huge administrative costs, advertising, marketing, bloated executive salaries, and high pharmaceutical prices. (Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, estimates a Medicare-for-all system would actually save all of us $10 trillion over 10 years).\n\n(2) The savings from Medicare-for-all would more than cover the costs of the rest of Bernie’s agenda—tuition-free education at public colleges, expanded Social Security benefits, improved infrastructure, and a fund to help cover paid family leave – and still leave us $2 trillion to cut federal deficits for the next ten years.\n\n(3) Many of these other “costs\" would also otherwise be paid by individuals and families -- for example, in college tuition and private insurance. So they shouldn't be considered added costs for the country as a whole, and may well save us money.\n\n(4) Finally, Bernie’s proposed spending on education and infrastructure aren’t really “spending” at all, but investments in the nation’s future productivity. If we don’t make them, we’re all poorer.\n\nThat Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal would do this giant dump on Bernie, based on misinformation and distortion, confirms Bernie's status as the candidate willing to take on the moneyed interests that the Wall Street Journal represents.

Violent crime arrests plummeted - Washington Post:\n\nIn a year full of distressing stories — especially about race, crime and violence in urban neighborhoods — this one points to some hope. Earlier this December, we covered a summer jobs program in Chicago that appeared to lead to fewer teenage arrests for violent crime. Our original story, republished below, also reminds us that policy solutions are possible — and possibly even inexpensive.\n\nA couple of years ago, the city of Chicago started a summer jobs programfor teenagers attending high schools in some of the city's high-crime, low-income neighborhoods. The program was meant, of course, to connect students to work. But officials also hoped that it might curb the kinds of problems — like higher crime — that arise when there's no work to be found.\n\nResearch on the program conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and just published in the journal Science suggests that these summer jobs have actually had such an effect: Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program had 43 percent fewer violent-crime arrests over 16 months, compared to students in a control group.\n\nThat number is striking for a couple of reasons: It implies that a relatively short (and inexpensive) intervention like an eight-week summer jobs program can have a lasting effect on teenage behavior. And it lends empirical support to a popular refrain by advocates: \"Nothing stops a bullet like a job.\"\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/26/chicago-gave-hundreds-of-high-risk-kids-a-summer-job-violent-crime-arrests-plummeted/","2014-12-28 16:46:31+00","124955570892789_766245140097159",9],[11318,"An economic agenda for America - Sen.

Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, white-haired and 73 years old, spoke for about an hour in his gravel-voiced, thick Brooklyn accent. His views are, he said, “a little different than most views.” Sanders denounced the power of the wealthy, advocated for single-payer health care and the public funding of elections — and called for a “political revolution” in America.\n\nThe crowd of mostly-elderly, liberal Iowans seemed to like the senator’s pitch. When Sanders said the top 25 hedge fund managers last year made more money than 425,000 public school teachers, many gasped. When he said Wall Street bankers were “too big to jail,” many clapped. And when he opened the floor for questions, one from a younger audience member, Rachel Antonuccio, led to particularly loud cheers. “I have a very simple question,” she said to Sanders. “Will you please run for president?”\nOnce Sanders quieted the applause, he didn’t give the standard politician’s coy non-response. He admitted that he’s “given thought to” running, saying he was motivated by the “enormous problems” the US faces — but he then quickly veered into his misgivings.\n-\n“I’m not much into hero-worship and all this stuff,” he said. “If somebody like me — or me — became president, there is no chance in the world that anything significant could be accomplished without the active, unprecedented support of millions of people, who would be prepared to make a commitment — the likes of which we have not made!”\n\nRead more: http://www.bernie.org/news/vox-bernie-sanders-vs-billionaires/\n","2014-10-15 14:05:00+00","124955570892789_725492874172386",9],[11408,"Join U.S. Sen.

Bernie Sanders and Sen. Tom Udall, POLITICO:\n\nWe are at a pivotal moment in American history.\n\nBuilding the United States of America has been long, arduous and rife with setbacks. But throughout the years, we have undoubtedly moved forward toward a more inclusive democracy. We expanded the right to vote. We eliminated the poll tax. We banned corporations from donating to campaigns after the scandals of the Gilded Age and imposed stricter limits on donations and expenditures after Watergate.\n\nBut today, those improvements are in serious jeopardy. The Supreme Court struck down a major part of the Voting Rights Act and Congress has yet to pass a fix. Voter ID laws are the new poll taxes. And thanks to years of pressure from conservative activists, five members of the Supreme Court have destroyed more than a century of campaign finance laws.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.bernie.org/news/threat-american-democracy/","2014-09-08 17:45:00+00","124955570892789_707884002599940",9],[11462,"Sen.

A typical worker’s compensation grew a measly 10.2 percent over the same period.\n\nThe average CEO compensation at the 350 publicly owned companies with the largest annual revenue in the U.S. last year was $15.2 million, according to the EPI, a left-leaning think tank. That’s a 21.7 percent rise since just 2010.\n\nThese massive increases are fattening CEOs' wallets while those of average Americans look ever leaner. Of all income groups, it's arguably minimum-wage earners who have suffered the most. The federal minimum wage has declined sharply since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation. If it had kept pace with increases in workplace productivity, the federal minimum wage would be $21.72 an hour -- triple what it is today.\n\nMeanwhile, median CEO pay among large public companies broke eight figures for the first time last year, according to a recent Associated Press/Equilar study.\n\nIn 2013, according to the EPI's study, the average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was nearly 296-to-1. That's down from a high of 383-to-1 in the boom years of the 2000s, but up from 193-to-1 in the depths of the recession. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/12/ceo-pay-report_n_5484622.html?view=print\u0026comm_ref=false","2014-06-12 21:18:01+00","124955570892789_667548816633459",9],[11545,"","2014-06-11 21:31:33+00","124955570892789_666932846695056",9],[11548,"","2014-06-10 19:56:55+00","124955570892789_666441043410903",9],[11549,"Join Sen.

The feisty Senator from Vermont is giving dinner speeches in Iowa, telling journalists he’s “prepared” to campaign, and is deciding whether he wants to compete for the Democratic nomination or take the “radical” step of heading an independent ticket. Assuming he rejects the Naderish option, which would upset many of his admirers who recall the 2000 debacle, a Sanders run could be excellent news for Democrats—in the next presidential race and beyond.\n\nAt a minimum, it would make the Democratic primary about more than the deeds and personality of Hillary the inevitable. Sanders, as eloquent a voice of left-wing populism as exists in the land, would press Clinton to support doubling the current minimum wage, imposing higher taxes on the wealthy, and increasing entitlement payments instead of reducing them in a “grand bargain” with Republicans. He would also push her to explain how she would end the dominion of big money in politics, long one of his signature issues. Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case.  According to multiple polls, these are all popular positions—among independents as well as Democrats. But without a shove from the left, Clinton is likely to stick to a mushy moderation, hoping a lengthy battle inside the GOP will result in a nominee too right-wing for the majority of the electorate to stomach.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.bernie.org/uncategorized/democrats-need-bernie-sanders-run-president-2/","2014-05-23 17:00:01+00","124955570892789_656970701024604",9],[11561,"Sen.

And it’s a gap that is widening, particularly among women.\n\nMr. Bosworth parsed this data from the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study, a survey that tracks the health and work-life of 26,000 Americans as they age and retire. The data is especially valuable as it tracks the same individuals every two years in what’s known as a longitudinal study, to see how their lives unfold.\n\nThe good news is that men of all incomes are living longer. Yet the data shows that the life expectancy of the wealthy is growing much faster than the life expectancy of the poor.\n\nHere’s the sort of detail this remarkable data set can show. You can look at a man born in 1940 and see that during the 1980s, the mid-point of his career, his income was in the top 10% for his age group. If that man lives to age 55 he can expect to live an additional 34.9 years, or to the age of 89.9. That’s six years longer than a man whose career followed the same arc, but who was born in 1920.\n\nContinue reading here: http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/04/18/the-richer-you-are-the-older-youll-get/","2014-04-20 21:16:06+00","124955570892789_642012462520428",9],[11605,"Read more here: http://www.bernie.org/splash-page/","2014-04-04 15:20:03+00","124955570892789_635039403217734",9],[11607,"Stay up to date with Sen.

When Bernie Sanders announces that he's been thinking about 2016, the same hysteria doesn't hold.\n\nThe senator from Vermont  isn't surprised. Although reporters have always been enamored of his hair -- which starts to resemble Charlton Heston parting a sea when Sanders begins passionately speaking about income inequality or Social Security -- and his gruff unwillingness to tell anecdotes lest you write about his personality rather than his policies, his political ambitions are rarely taken seriously.\n\nWith presidential candidates now relying on raising millions from small donors and big donors — besides having one, two or three outside groups raising millions on the side — a candidate who has made fighting big donors and outside groups part of his platform seems to have pre-written his campaign's death knell.

Without any aggregate limit, a donor can now give millions directly to candidates and parties. The 5-to-4 decision in the McCutcheon v. FEC case is being described as the “next Citizens United,” referring to the 2010 ruling that opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate spending on U.S. elections. We speak to Independent Sen.

Sanders, The Huffington Post:\n\nAs a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process. The results of that decision are clear. In the coming months and years the Koch brothers and other extraordinarily wealthy families will spend billions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates to the Senate, the House, governors' mansions and the presidency of the United States. These billionaires already own much of our economy. That, apparently, is not enough. Now, they want to own the United States government as well.\n\nFour years ago, the Supreme Court handed down the 5-4 ruling in Citizens United vs the Federal Election Commission. A few weeks ago, they announced another horrendous campaign finance decision in McCutcheon vs. FEC giving even more political power to the rich. Now, many Republicans want to push this Supreme Court to go even further. In the name of \"free speech,\" they want the Court to eliminate all restrictions on campaign spending -- a position that Justice Thomas supported in McCutcheon -- and a view supported by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Importantly, as a means of being able to exercise unprecedented power over the political process, this has been the position of the Koch brothers for at least the last 34 years.\n\nThe Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in America, making most of their money in the fossil fuel industry. According to Forbes Magazine, they saw their wealth increase last year from $68 billion to $80 billion. In other words, under the \"anti-business\", \"socialist\" and \"oppressive\" Obama administration, their wealth went up by $12 billion in one year.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/who-are-the-koch-brothers_b_5165995.html ","2014-04-18 15:05:00+00","124955570892789_640826042639070",9],[11592,"Sign up to receive updates from Sen.

Veterans who started receiving V.A. disability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits reduced by $1,425 a year at age 45, $2,341 at age 55 and $3,231 at age 65. Benefits for more than 350,000 surviving spouses and children would also be cut.\n\nDuring his first run for the White House, in 2008, Mr. Obama said he would not cut Social Security. I hope he remembers that promise and keeps it.\n\nI also hope he follows up on another suggestion that he made during that campaign and gets behind my legislation to raise the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, extending the life of Social Security for generations to come without the need to cut benefits or raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nYes, we must move forward on deficit reduction, but it must not be done on the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in this country.\n\nBERNARD SANDERS\nWashington, April 1, 2013","2013-04-02 18:32:28+00","124955570892789_577131818971923",9],[11719,"Check out Bernie’s recent op-ed for The Huffington Post, which discusses “too big to fail” financial institutions and legislation that he will soon be introducing to break them up.\n\n“If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.”","2013-04-01 17:35:46+00","124955570892789_548880718490303",9],[11721,"Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate on record opposing cuts to Social Security and veterans’ benefits through the use of chained CPI.\n\nPassing this amendment is a step forward, but we have a lot more work to do.\n\nPlease join Daily Kos and Sen.
