But honestly, I felt great out there. The car was strong, my pace was good, I didn't give up, kept pushing and made up the time so that's what's most important to me. Generally, when I'm told to push it means the team is bringing me in that lap so that's what I did. \n\nIn the end, they left me out for another lap which caught me by surprise. By the time I came round to do the second lap my rear tyres were gone from where I'd been pushing so hard. Even so, it was my mistake locking up the rears and ultimately that cost me the win. Nico drove a great race - defending well and not making any mistakes. But it's clear I had the pace. It's not a big deal, though. That's motor racing. \n\nObviously, I lost some points which is disappointing. But it's a great team result with a record-breaking one-two finish and I really enjoyed the race. The car is just fantastic - the best I've ever driven - so a big thank you to the team for all their hard work. I'll be pushing just as hard in Abu Dhabi and hopefully we'll get to have another great race like we saw today. #BrazilianGP #Brazil #BrazilGP #Interlagos #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS - Photos by Steve Etherington","2014-11-09 22:54:23+00","132609463487057_764618813619449",32],[53525,"Some images from todays Qualification by Steve Etherington #BrazilianGP #BrazilGP #Brazil #F1 #Interlagos #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-11-08 21:01:23+00","132609463487057_763975397017124",32],[53527,"Lets do this #BrazilianGP #Brazil #interlagos #F1 - photos by Steve Etherington http://instagram.com/p/vIqdG0L0wW/","2014-11-08 10:48:49+00","132609463487057_763653987049265",32],[53529,"Few images from yesterday.

It's hard to tell where the tyres are compared to 2013 with the different compounds as we didn't have any dry running until the race last year. \n\nOtherwise the circuit felt good.

Firstly I'm so proud to have contributed to the work of this great team, to get the first Constructors' Championship for Mercedes-Benz is a huge achievement. Massive congratulations to the guys back in the UK and Germany, it's history for us. Today I had to manage the tyres a lot through the race; managing the fuel wasn't too bad. The car felt great and I didn't have to push too hard. At the end, when Nico was behind, I needed to match his times, which I did. I've thoroughly enjoyed the weekend here in Russia, it's a great place. It's been one of my favourite venues so far this year, so it's very cool to have won the first race here. The fans have been amazing; I didn't know so many people followed it here but they were all there in the grandstands and looked excited! The organisers have also done a great job - the layout, the surface and the whole event; I take my hat off to them. #sochi #SochiAutodrom #RussianGP #Russia #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/uD4pVbr0ys/","2014-10-12 17:29:26+00","132609463487057_744925318922132",32],[53584,"What an amazing weekend!

I crossed the line and I was just hoping I got it; when they tell you, it's the biggest relief - a great feeling. The corners are mostly medium and high speed where you need a lot of downforce, so tomorrow should be a challenge. It's a long run down to Turn One and we need to be mindful there are opportunities to overtake here. It was great to see such a strong turnout for the first Saturday of running at this new track.

My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. \n\nThis weekend is a new experience for Formula One as we head to Russia for the first time. I like a challenge and a new circuit always provides that. Of course, we've run through plenty of laps on the simulator - but you never really know what it will be like until you get out there and feel your way into the track. \n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what it's really like and how our car performs there.

I lost a lot of time at the beginning of my last lap and at that point I thought pole was lost. \n\nBut I just kept going and managed to pull some time back. As a driver, through the weekend you plan to have the last lap in qualifying as your best. By that time the track has improved and you should have the settings as close to their optimum as they're going to get. \n\nBut there was so much happening out there and I was just trying not to look at what was going on around me. I was surprised by how close everyone was - the Red Bulls and Ferraris looked quick all day - and it was really fun to be a part of that session. \n\nThe team have done a fantastic job to bring the car here, to a circuit where downforce is so important, and be at the front once again, so a big thank you to them. It's going to be a tough race tomorrow. Coming into the weekend we had an opinion about how the tyres would behave, but the long runs yesterday changed all that. \n\nTrying to manage them will be a big challenge but hopefully it will be an entertaining one for the fans. I'm on the clean side of the track so I'm hoping for a clean start and a strong race. #SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-09-20 16:21:15+00","132609463487057_729571690457495",32],[53646,"#SingaporeGP #TeamLH #pole #onetwo MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tLIf0NL08c/","2014-09-20 16:26:02+00","132609463487057_729574723790525",32],[53650,"Nico looks very quick, as do the Ferraris and the Red Bulls, but I'm feeling good this weekend and I'm focused on the job #SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tIo8XQL00F/","2014-09-19 17:22:27+00","132609463487057_729053953842602",32],[53651,"Today was a work in progress. We made some changes between P1 and P2 and, whether it was those changes or the track itself, the balance didn't feel right. It felt like we lost a bit of performance but we'll look into the details and see what it was tonight. \n\nThe long run was okay - I had a bit of traffic which wasn't ideal, as when you back off to rebuild the gap the tyres come back to you a bit which may not give an accurate picture of exactly how long they will last. \n\nPole here has always been very important. The right side of the grid, for example, always seems to get the better starts. Being up at the front will be crucial and that's obviously my target for qualifying tomorrow. \n\nNico looks very quick, as do the Ferraris and the Red Bulls, but I'm feeling good this weekend and I'm focused on the job. \n\n#SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-09-19 16:59:02+00","132609463487057_729042940510370",32],[53653,"Can't wait to get out on the track! #SinagporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tF2mtxr043/","2014-09-18 15:19:55+00","132609463487057_728451797236151",32],[53654,"Really pumped for #SingaporeGP #letsdothis #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tF2WjjL04O/","2014-09-18 15:19:50+00","132609463487057_728451750569489",32],[53655,"Got to hang out with my mum, sis, my nephew Kaiden \u0026 Roscoe last night, My two best buddies lol #family http://instagram.com/p/tDcCDUr04Z/","2014-09-17 16:45:07+00","132609463487057_727842847297046",32],[53656,"Big thanks MVagusta for lending me this bike in Monza. #brutale800dragster #boss http://instagram.com/p/tDbmFHL03y/","2014-09-17 16:45:04+00","132609463487057_727842797297051",32],[53657,"The #SinagporeGP is a really exciting race where the smallest mistake can make a huge difference!

You make this race and thank you so much for your support! \n\nBig congratulations to the team for our performance this weekend. We said we wanted a one-two and we got it today; this result is important for everyone. It was a difficult race for me though. The launch sequence didn't engage properly for the formation lap and then again for the start. \n\nI tried to pull away as fast as possible, basically I just floored it and hoped for the best! Fortunately I didn't lose too many places and was able to get past Kevin, then have a good battle with Felipe. When I closed up to Nico, I didn't want to hold back as the car felt good and I knew from experience that the only chance would be at the start of the stint when the tyres were fresh so I went for it. \n\nI'm really pleased with the win, it's feels like I have some momentum back as we go into the final races.","2014-09-07 16:16:49+00","132609463487057_722341314513866",32],[53652,"Great to meet some fans before the weekend starts!

Your visor is almost level with the ground, so it's not like looking from above where you can see the different patches. \n\nThat makes it really hard to pick out the areas where you can find grip, but it's also a lot of fun.

I didn't fully understand what had happened until I saw the replay just now, but I gave him plenty of space, took the corner like I usually do and suddenly felt a big hit from behind. There was nothing I could do about it and that was effectively my race over. I wanted to retire the car early - not because I was giving up, but because I couldn't catch the people in front of me and even with a safety car I don't think I would have been able to pass them. The car was quite badly damaged and my thoughts were to preserve the engine after the last one was destroyed in Hungary. What happens next is not my call - that's one for the bosses to make.

I can't express the pain I feel when we have issues such as in the last couple of races; it's hard to swallow and difficult to come back the next day and get the right balance between not attacking too much, but pushing to the limit. The two safety car periods helped quite a lot, but naturally I looked fast and had the pace this weekend, so there was an opportunity for more points. I was in the same race as Nico and if I let him past and he had the opportunity to pull away, then he would have come back and overtaken me. I didn't understand why the team asked me to do that as he didn't get close enough to overtake and I didn't want to lift off and lose ground to Fernando. I would like to say a big congratulations to Daniel and Fernando. It was close at the end and it was getting very hard to keep Nico behind as he was catching at close to 3 seconds a lap. Coming back through shows how great this car and team is, and this result is much more satisfying than an easy win.

I don't really have any secrets there - I've just been very fortunate over the years and it's a circuit I really enjoy.

From a personal point of view, I can't be too ecstatic about the race because it has been a tough weekend for me and I've ultimately lost more points to Nico in the championship battle. But I'm grateful that I could limit the damage with a podium finish. When you are sitting on the grid basically in last place, with no other cars in your mirrors, it's very hard to imagine that you could be standing up there two hours later. I'm so grateful to the team for this car, I really take my hat off to them for building a machine that can put in that kind of performance. To be honest, it was a pretty straightforward race for me, although I had some trouble following what was going on and where I was running at times. I had a nice battle with Kimi early on, when I was lucky not to damage the front wing, then the incident with Jenson was just unfortunate. He has been such a gentleman this year and not given me too much trouble getting past but it was just a misunderstanding today. I wasn't close enough to try and pass but I was on the inside line in the corner. It looked like he had gone wide, then he cut back across the corner and perhaps he didn't see me there. I lost quite a bit of downforce with the damage and it made it very hard to look after the front left tyre. I had a lot of understeer and the tyre was degrading fast, which is the reason why we converted from a two-stop strategy to three. Then the team called me in early on the first set of option tyres because we expected a Safety Car to come out - and I was surprised that there wasn't one, to be honest I caught Valtteri pretty fast in the final laps but he just had too much straightline speed to get past. I'm doing absolutely everything I can to get back on level terms with Nico in the title battle: I can't focus more or work harder than I am doing right now. This championship is proving a big challenge for me but that's how I love it - and I wouldn't have it any other way.","2014-07-20 20:14:12+00","132609463487057_693262954088369",32],[53792,"#germangp #teamlhhttp://instagram.com/p/qqgvDmL01I/","2014-07-20 07:39:55+00","132609463487057_692944690786862",32],[53794,"#germangp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/qqgr7br01F/","2014-07-20 07:39:51+00","132609463487057_692944610786870",32],[53797,"The heat will play a big part tomorrow! #germangp #teamlh / photos by steve etherington.http://ift.tt/1n1mAV8","2014-07-18 16:34:11+00","132609463487057_692128924201772",32],[53802,"It was a pretty good day today.

A huge thank you to my family and all of the fans for pushing me on - I couldn't have done it without them. Nico had a pretty big gap at the beginning of the race but I kept pushing and was happy with my pace. After extending my first stint, we switched to the prime tyres and I honestly couldn't believe the pace that I had and was closing up to Nico. Of course, he then had a problem and I saw him pull over. It's a shame for the team and I never want to see a team-mate fall behind - I always want to battle it out - but I'm sure we will get to do it again in the future.

The feeling in the car has been good all weekend and I think we had the pace. My first lap in Q3 was looking good before I went wide in the second-to-last corner, and I think that lap would probably have done it. Then on the second run, I hit the brakes into Turn 2 and just locked the rears; I still need to look at the data to see exactly what happened. It's a long race and I need to try and recover as much as I can from this loss. The shot for the win will be very hard so I guess it's mainly a case of damage limitation; I will be doing all I can to put myself in a strong position and to get good points for the team.

I have had the pace in the car all weekend here but I wasn't able to capitalise on that, so getting second place from a bad weekend is pretty good, I guess. I had a rocket start - it's something we've be working hard on all year and it was one of the best I've ever had. You can't ever plan what's going to happen but I managed to put the car in all the right places and climb to P4 by the end of the first lap. We were managing the brakes a lot today, because I was in traffic for most of the race and it was the most important thing to bring the car home, so that was a real balancing act. But the strategy worked really well for me to get into second position, then I tried to start pushing Nico - but he didn't make any mistakes and I didn't have the chance to overtake. The guys did a fantastic job today to get us another one-two and the fans here in Austria have been insane.

Montreal has been a good track for me so to come here and not finish is disappointing but there are plenty more races ahead of us this season so let's hope for better fortune. There was nothing I could do about our issues really. We were managing the loss of power but as soon as I finally made the jump on Nico in the second pit stop, my brakes failed going into turn 10. It's great for the team that Nico was able to hold on and get second place today but it's tough for me. That's two DNFs now this season and now I have to try and recover the points gap again. But these are learning experiences: we'll learn as a team and get stronger. Congratulations to Daniel today. It's awesome for him to get his first win and I know this will be a really special day for him.","2014-06-08 22:50:20+00","132609463487057_668064426608222",32],[53950,"#canadagp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/o9IQJLL0-v/","2014-06-07 20:06:49+00","132609463487057_667472840000714",32],[53952,"#canadagp #teamlh Photo by www.steveetherington.com  http://instagram.com/p/o9INIwr0-s/","2014-06-07 20:06:47+00","132609463487057_667472803334051",32],[53953,"#canadagp #teamlhhttp://instagram.com/p/o9H_Gor0-N/","2014-06-07 20:06:44+00","132609463487057_667472763334055",32],[53955,"Nico did a fantastic lap but it wasn't the greatest qualifying session for me because I went wide a couple of times on my lap, in turns six and eight.

It's great for the team that we have a one-two on the grid but I am expecting it to be a tough race: it's not that easy to overtake here, especially in the same car and with Nico being so close on pace. I will do what I can tomorrow and we will be trying to score as many points as we can. I also want to say something about this amazing weekend in Canada.

You're always trying to find the limit so we're not quite where we want to be yet. The Ferraris looked quite close today and the rest of the field seemed closer in general but hopefully not too close! It's very hard to overtake here so pole position is important.

We have our bosses from Mercedes-Benz here today and it's great for the team that we were able to give them a one-two finish. In all my career, I've never before had a car or a performance gap like this. Nico drove a fantastic race and I struggled to keep him behind, but I just managed it at the end. I had the same problems with the car this afternoon that I found yesterday in qualifying: I couldn't attack the corners properly because of snap oversteer and that's where Nico was catching me. I'm just so proud of this team: we are looking very strong and I'm enjoying every moment and every step of the way. There's still a long way to go this season, though, so we are staying humble, getting our heads down and working hard. I still have a bit more time to find from the car because it's very, very close with Nico, so I have to keep working on that. But it's a great feeling to be leading the championship.","2014-05-11 16:17:37+00","132609463487057_651380411609957",32],[54070,"Pole position #teamlh - Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com #spanishgphttp://instagram.com/p/n1WLwnr09L/","2014-05-10 23:07:49+00","132609463487057_651009708313694",32],[54072,"Pole! #spanishgp - Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com  http://instagram.com/p/n1V898L082/","2014-05-10 23:07:42+00","132609463487057_651009654980366",32],[54074,"P1 - 1:25.524, 33 laps! #spanishgp - Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com http://instagram.com/p/nyFBolr03w/","2014-05-09 16:34:39+00","132609463487057_650325665048765",32],[54052,"#TBT #throwbackthursday http://www.lewishamilton.com/post/32d6f952-a058-4b22-984e-fa1b97b3413a/","2014-05-15 09:43:30+00","132609463487057_653612258053439",32],[54053,"www.lewishamilton.com has a new look!

We completed a lot of practice starts and tried a few different things with the car during the afternoon once the track dried out a bit. Of course, test days aren't as much fun as a race but it's part of the job. It's important for the team and it's also been productive for me in terms of getting the car where I want it after struggling at times last weekend. Conditions were obviously very different but we got some dry running in and I felt happier with the car by the end of the day. Every lap you do in the car you learn a little bit more and these in-season tests are useful given the limited running time we have. Although we have a good advantage right now, the moment we stand still our rivals will be ready to pounce so we have to stay on our toes at all times. I've got a busy week leading up to Monaco but I'll be doing some work back at the factory before that weekend. It's a massively demanding circuit and with the oversteer moments created by the extra torque from the cars this year we'll have to watch our proximity to the walls much more closely. Every driver loves going to Monaco and I'm aiming to keep up the positive momentum from the last four races.","2014-05-13 17:28:31+00","132609463487057_652677411480257",32],[54060,"Watching toy story 3 #family http://instagram.com/p/n6TOdwr0_b/","2014-05-12 21:10:07+00","132609463487057_652095571538441",32],[54068,"Wow!!

I was really happy on Friday and we changed of small things overnight, just the tiniest of tweaks. But it was a real handful today because track conditions had changed. Nico had a strong P3 and first two sessions of qualifying, so we were making small adjustments to the differential to try and make improvements to how the car was handling for Q3. On that final, run I had to eke out everything and more from the car and myself to get pole and I'm so happy I managed it. The hard work from the team and the development step we have made this weekend are totally inspiring for me - I haven't experienced this level of performance before. I've never won at the circuit and I would love to, because my support in Barcelona has been growing every year and I have some amazing fans here in Spain. We are going to give it everything we can tomorrow to get the win.","2014-05-10 18:26:41+00","132609463487057_650912468323418",32],[54075,"#teamlh #spanishgp - Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com http://instagram.com/p/nyIO6-r08t/","2014-05-09 17:03:50+00","132609463487057_650342588380406",32],[54076,"It's been a great day today and I'm happy to be back in the car after what feels like quite a long break. I can feel the positive step forward that we've made with the car so a big thank you to everyone back at our factories for all of their hard work since China. Our two practice sessions today went very smoothly, in fact I've not had such a good Friday for a very long time! Barcelona is a difficult circuit in terms of the tyres so our running was all about trying to see how long the tyres would last and we were able to make some positive changes with that during P2 this afternoon. It's very difficult to overtake here so we will do everything we can to qualify as high as possible tomorrow, but really it is all about the race and looking after those tyres is the most important thing. Just finally, it's great to see so many fans here today enjoying the action in this beautiful weather.","2014-05-09 16:05:04+00","132609463487057_650307621717236",32],[54077,"What an inspiration #spanishgp - Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com http://instagram.com/p/nwNVQsL0-_/","2014-05-08 23:09:48+00","132609463487057_649946108420054",32],[54081,"Check out this cool vid \"The Making Of Liquid \u0026 Metal\" with PETRONAS MOTORSPORTS and MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS \n\nhttp://www.lewishamilton.com/post/making-of-liquid-metal/ ","2014-05-06 11:43:54+00","132609463487057_648494035231928",32],[54082,"If you haven't already go check out why I think Senna is the ultimate hero...#Senna \n\nhttp://www.lewishamilton.com/post/senna-hero/","2014-05-02 15:54:13+00","132609463487057_646593172088681",32],[54088,"It's been good to have a bit of a break between races: for us as drivers and also for the team who have been working flat out for so many weeks.

It's definitely the most satisfying feeling to come away with pole position in these wet conditions because the track is so slippery and you need to find the grip to put the lap together.

I'm in a really good place at the moment and walking around the garage too, you can see the positive energy within the team right now. Everyone is focused on getting the maximum from these early races and continuing to build beyond the strong start we've made to the season. I've had some ups and downs in China. On one side I've only finished outside of the podium places twice at this circuit. On the other, in my first season in Formula One I threw away a championship lead here by going into the gravel coming into the pits. Generally, though, I'm getting stronger every time I come to this track and it suits my driving style quite well.

Of course, the nature of a tyre test means we haven't learnt anything in particular in terms of improving the car but it's useful for Pirelli and therefore useful to us in the long term. They just gave me different sets and I told them how each felt. The plan was just to get in as many laps as we could. The times mean nothing as everyone had their own programmes to run. It's been a fantastic few weeks for the team but also a long stint away, so I'm sure everyone is looking forward to heading back home for a well-deserved rest.

That was a really tough race tonight and I am absolutely delighted to have come home with the win. It's a long time since I had a race like that! My weekend started off well but I didn't really have great pace for qualifying and the race. I knew that I needed a good start and to go into the first corner in the lead was crucial to my race this evening. From there, it was such a battle. Nico drove fantastically well and, in all honesty, he had the pace on me today but I managed to hold on. I knew when the safety car came out that Nico would be on the option tyres and that he would be quick. To try and stay ahead of him was so hard and when I came across the line I was just so relieved. When you're racing your team-mate, the pressure is really intense and we both knew that we had to bring the cars home for the team and for the championship. All credit to the team for allowing us to race and I hope the fans loved the show that we were able to put on tonight. A big thank you to the team, especially to my engineers for all the information they were giving me during the race, and to everyone here and back at the factories for all their hard work. Another one-two is just fantastic for us. I'm also very proud to have joined Fangio with 24 Grand Prix wins today, he's one of the great racers of all time so that's a real honour.","2014-04-06 19:47:45+00","132609463487057_630910966990235",32],[54137,"It's been a pretty decent day for us. The car felt good from the outset which allowed us to spend time getting to grips with the tyres. The softs in particular seem to be working well and we saw a fair difference in lap time between them and the mediums. The focus today was on the second session as the timing and conditions reflects that of the rest of the weekend and the difference in temperature between the sessions was quite large. The key was to not react too much to that change in terms of our approach to set-up and we seemed to manage that well. It was great driving under the spotlights here: the circuit looks even better at night and you don't really notice a difference in terms of visibility. It's actually quite nice to be driving in cooler conditions too. As always there are still some tweaks we can make to improve the car, but overall I'm feeling good.

It's the first time I've driven the car on the limit in the wet, but it felt great and I'm so happy with the job the team has done. To be on pole here today is a fantastic result for us. It was great fun and I'm really looking forward to the race tomorrow. It's going to be tough, but we'll do our best and see what happens. I am very proud to have scored pole number 100 for Mercedes-Benz in Formula One. I have only driven with Mercedes power since my debut in 2007 and the whole Mercedes team has done an incredible job meeting the challenge of these new rules.

Other teams have been going out for single-lap runs, starting a few hours after we had first hit the track, so to have started running through our test programme was very encouraging. The car feels quite good, especially considering it's so early in our programme, so overall it's been a positive day. Of course, it's unfortunate to end the day early when everyone has worked so hard and we had looked like easily completing the most mileage of anyone here today, but we'll make that track time back and it's better to have these things happen now than in Melbourne.

It's been a fantastic week for the team. We've put a lot of laps on the car which is a huge accomplishment. It's a bit early to say this definitely, but right now the car feels pretty good. Like every year we've got a lot of work to do; it's a new challenge this season and the workload is maybe a bit higher than in previous years, but it's a new experience for everyone and I'm enjoying it. This week has just been about getting the mileage on the car and we've managed to do that quite successfully, which is really encouraging as reliability is the biggest positive we could hope to take away from here. So far so good; now we just have to continue working hard and see what happens in Bahrain.","2014-01-31 17:10:11+00","132609463487057_595365670544765",32],[54262,"A little update from today.

We've shown the strength within this team through all the hard work that's gone into getting the car here, bouncing back from the issue on Tuesday and then going out there and following up 97 laps yesterday with a further 62 today; it's a huge accomplishment for everyone involved. Proving reliability at this stage is crucial and every lap is precious, as this is going to be a seriously challenging year for every team. I'm feeling very positive after these tests and every day on track is another step forwards, but there are so many challenges ahead of us in the coming weeks and months that we just have to take those steps one at a time.","2014-01-30 17:15:07+00","132609463487057_594853560595976",32],[54263,"Want to see why I chose #44?

That result means so much to everyone and I'm so grateful to have been a part of it this year. From my side, it was a tough race today. I don't know what happened exactly with Valtteri and will have to have a look at the replay. I thought that I had moved to the left, he outbraked me and then we touched but it happened so quickly and it was obviously judged that I did something wrong. I was having a good race until that point in fourth place and a podium might have been possible as I was closing on Fernando. That's why I'm so disappointed with my own race but of course I'm delighted for the team. They have done an incredible job this year and really deserve this result. It's the reward for what I know has been many years of hard work and my thoughts are with everyone here at the track and back at our factories at Brackley and Brixworth. We've got so much to look forward to next season so I'll put today behind me quickly and focus on what should be a great year in 2014.","2013-11-24 19:05:48+00","132609463487057_561587867255879",32],[54361,"The conditions were tricky out there today and it's a real shame for the fans that they didn't get to see more action on track.

Our car feels pretty good at this early stage but there are definitely some areas we can improve overnight. We're working towards a strong qualifying performance tomorrow afternoon, ideally on the second row, and then hopefully a place on the podium, that would be nice.","2013-10-25 11:30:52+00","132609463487057_545382252209774",32],[54401,"","2013-10-15 11:43:59+00","132609463487057_540279229386743",32],[54402,"Big thanks for your support for my new site - I'll be watching for #TeamLH for more of your photos that I can use for  http://www.lewishamilton.com/  #blessed","2013-10-14 11:30:58+00","132609463487057_539655229449143",32],[54403,"#TeamLH #LHF1","2013-10-13 11:08:50+00","132609463487057_539056202842379",32],[54404,"I got a fantastic start this afternoon, better than both Red Bulls for probably the first time this year.

It wasn't his fault at all, just one of those things that wasn't meant to be this afternoon. I feel most gutted for the team - the guys here at the track and in the factory - because they are doing an amazing job right now and we're just not getting the reward for it.

Suzuka is one of the few circuits we have left in Formula One with the authenticity of a real old-school circuit. I drove there for the first time in 2009 and it takes a while to pick up pace each year because of how fast-flowing it is. If you touch the grass at any point, it's going to spin you off into the wall, so it's a much more demanding circuit in terms of precision, positioning and turning points for each corner. It's a real race track where you have to think ahead as a driver and it just needs crazy levels of downforce from the car. From my point of view, the car felt fantastic to drive in Korea when everything was hooked up, so I am excited to get to Japan and see what we can do there.","2013-10-08 10:55:27+00","132609463487057_536421593105840",32],[54417,"#LHF1","2013-10-08 06:37:25+00","132609463487057_536339089780757",32],[54559,"","2013-06-08 19:50:49+00","132609463487057_478179432263390",32],[54374,"I'm really looking forward to returning to Austin this weekend.

We can still make improvements overnight, and I have some things I want to do with the set-up, but it's been a good start for us! #LHF1","2013-10-04 14:29:06+00","132609463487057_534558659958800",32],[54422,"I'm looking forward to getting to Korea this week and going racing again. I've had a couple of decent results at the Korea International Circuit over the past three years and I do enjoy the circuit layout. It's a good racing track with places that you can attack to overtake which makes it a good challenge for the drivers. We'll be hoping to improve our qualifying performance this weekend to give the best possible chance in the race and I hope we can have a strong weekend in Korea.","2013-10-02 10:08:27+00","132609463487057_533674823380517",32],[54426,"That was a really tough race, probably the most physically demanding of the year. We tried our best and the car felt good tonight but unfortunately we paid the price for not qualifying further ahead yesterday. I didn't have the best start and had to go wide to avoid Mark at turn one. From there, it was difficult to follow the race and my position. Whilst the timing of the safety car definitely didn't help us, we need to go back through our strategy and see what we could possibly have done differently in that situation. I'm not sure we could have done what Fernando and Kimi did by staying out on that set of tyres for so long, though. Of course, it's a little disappointing to come away with only fifth place but I gave it my all out there and we'll come back stronger. Our aim is to get back ahead of Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship and see if we can get another win before the end of the season.","2013-09-22 21:49:48+00","132609463487057_529000590514607",32],[54428,"Qualifying didn't quite come together for me this evening. I tried my best out there. Clearly the car was quicker than what I was able to get out of it tonight so, of course, it's frustrating not to have qualified closer to the front as Nico did. So not a good day for me but that's life. We'll turn today's negative into a positive overnight and I'll be pushing as hard as I can in the race tomorrow. There are still people ahead of me that we can beat and our target will be to get on the podium, that would be amazing.","2013-09-21 17:47:05+00","132609463487057_528456190569047",32],[54429,"Hi everyone, quick update on todays practice. It wasn't the perfect Friday for us but we got on with our programme and know where we have to make improvements for tomorrow. The balance of the car felt really good in P1 but it definitely went away from us in P2. There is a lot of work to do this evening but we're used to that on a Friday night and will just get on with it and focus on our car and performance. It's so difficult to overtake around at this circuit that you want to qualify as high up as possible and, of course, aim for the front row but that will be tough. The circuit is much improved here without the chicane and Turn 10 feels like a much nicer corner now.","2013-09-20 15:59:11+00","132609463487057_527988183949181",32],[54430,"Hello guys, anyone ready for another race weekend? I have always really enjoyed the Singapore Grand Prix weekend and the unique 'night' timetable that we have to follow there. It certainly makes a change from the usual race weekend. As a street circuit, the Marina Bay track layout really suits my style. It's quite a testing circuit and you need to work the car hard the whole way round the lap to make the most of the tight corners and braking zones. We've had a tough couple of weekends in Belgium and Italy but I know that everyone at the team is determined to bounce back from here and make the most of the opportunities over the last seven races of the season.","2013-09-17 10:05:40+00","132609463487057_526055340809132",32],[54431,"","2013-09-09 11:04:50+00","132609463487057_522105091204157",32],[54433,"I gave it my all out there today; the pace of the car was great but unfortunately we paid the price for not qualifying far enough up the field. My radio failed right at the start of the race and it's really tough when that happens as you rely on the advice and information from the team to manage your race. I didn't even know about the slow puncture until after the race so now it makes more sense why we had to make the extra stop. I did have some fun this afternoon, particularly fighting with Kimi. We'll keep pushing together as a team and I know that we'll bounce back for Singapore. We'll be giving it everything to make up for this weekend with a stronger performance there.","2013-09-08 15:27:30+00","132609463487057_521701647911168",32],[54435,"#LHF1","2013-09-06 14:35:53+00","132609463487057_520788004669199",32],[54439,"So, Monza next. It is a truly amazing circuit and it's a great feeling to drive at our top speeds of the year there. The layout and atmosphere of Monza are very special and it really feels like you are going back to Formula One's roots when you race there. The car has a completely different aerodynamic package to anywhere else on the calendar with really low downforce to make the most of the four long straights. My win in Italy last year was the first of my career at this circuit and it was a great feeling. We had a strong weekend in Belgium with a good team result and that's what we need to keeping doing in the second half of the season.","2013-09-03 10:20:03+00","132609463487057_519289834819016",32],[54441,"Good morning!!!

I made a nice start and it felt like the exit out of turn one was good, too. But Seb just caught me on the run out of Eau Rouge and there wasn't really much I could do to defend: I moved once, like we are allowed to, but then I just had to watch him glide by. From that point, it was very difficult to hold on to him, and the same thing happened with Fernando, too, later in the race. We have done a good job this weekend but Spa and Monza are always unique tracks because of the low-drag requirements and I expect we will be more competitive in Singapore again. It's still a great team result to finish third with Nico right behind me in fourth, so we will take the positives from this into the next races.","2013-08-27 09:13:48+00","132609463487057_516360471778619",32],[54456,"My little cousins, badass football players.
