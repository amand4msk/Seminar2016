But honestly, I felt great out there. The car was strong, my pace was good, I didn't give up, kept pushing and made up the time so that's what's most important to me. Generally, when I'm told to push it means the team is bringing me in that lap so that's what I did. \n\nIn the end, they left me out for another lap which caught me by surprise. By the time I came round to do the second lap my rear tyres were gone from where I'd been pushing so hard. Even so, it was my mistake locking up the rears and ultimately that cost me the win. Nico drove a great race - defending well and not making any mistakes. But it's clear I had the pace. It's not a big deal, though. That's motor racing. \n\nObviously, I lost some points which is disappointing. But it's a great team result with a record-breaking one-two finish and I really enjoyed the race. The car is just fantastic - the best I've ever driven - so a big thank you to the team for all their hard work.

It's just practice so that's what we're out there trying to do. \n\nI'm not sure how many laps we'll get out of the tyres as there were quite a few red flags at the end so we didn't get the best opportunity for long runs but that's the same for everyone. It's hard to tell where the tyres are compared to 2013 with the different compounds as we didn't have any dry running until the race last year. \n\nOtherwise the circuit felt good. It's nice and smooth and the grip is good. It's different every time we come here and you never know what the weather is going to do.

The car felt great and I didn't have to push too hard. At the end, when Nico was behind, I needed to match his times, which I did. I've thoroughly enjoyed the weekend here in Russia, it's a great place. It's been one of my favourite venues so far this year, so it's very cool to have won the first race here.

It's fun to drive. Today, the laps in practice felt more special. In qualifying it seemed a bit harder to get that special lap but I'm grateful that I was able to improve. I crossed the line and I was just hoping I got it; when they tell you, it's the biggest relief - a great feeling. The corners are mostly medium and high speed where you need a lot of downforce, so tomorrow should be a challenge. It's a long run down to Turn One and we need to be mindful there are opportunities to overtake here. It was great to see such a strong turnout for the first Saturday of running at this new track. Hopefully we can give them a good show tomorrow. #RussianGP #SochiAutodrom #sochi MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS #TeamLH http://instagram.com/p/uBJsKlr07K/","2014-10-11 16:08:18+00","132609463487057_744198685661462",1],[977,"#RussianGP #Russia #sochi #SochiAutodrom - photos by Steve Etherington MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS #TeamLH http://instagram.com/p/t-Z1mNr0-G/","2014-10-10 14:18:46+00","132609463487057_743454982402499",1],[979,"Here's my thoughts on the new circuit http://www.lewishamilton.com/post/russia-practice-2014/ … #RussianGP #Sochi\n#SochiAutodrom MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-10-10 13:24:41+00","132609463487057_743427112405286",1],[981,"#LetsDoThis #RussianGP #TeamLH #ForzaJules MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/t76FLsr06I/","2014-10-09 15:28:10+00","132609463487057_742836509131013",1],[983,"Here's a few pics from today at the #SochiAutodrom #LetsDoThis #RussianGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-10-09 15:05:13+00","132609463487057_742825839132080",1],[985,"You are with us in spirit bro \u0026 in our hearts.

My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. \n\nThis weekend is a new experience for Formula One as we head to Russia for the first time. I like a challenge and a new circuit always provides that. Of course, we've run through plenty of laps on the simulator - but you never really know what it will be like until you get out there and feel your way into the track. \n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what it's really like and how our car performs there.

You make this race and thank you so much for your support! \n\nBig congratulations to the team for our performance this weekend. We said we wanted a one-two and we got it today; this result is important for everyone. It was a difficult race for me though. The launch sequence didn't engage properly for the formation lap and then again for the start. \n\nI tried to pull away as fast as possible, basically I just floored it and hoped for the best! Fortunately I didn't lose too many places and was able to get past Kevin, then have a good battle with Felipe. When I closed up to Nico, I didn't want to hold back as the car felt good and I knew from experience that the only chance would be at the start of the stint when the tyres were fresh so I went for it. \n\nI'm really pleased with the win, it's feels like I have some momentum back as we go into the final races.","2014-09-07 16:16:49+00","132609463487057_722341314513866",1],[1062,"Hero #Monza #ItalianGPhttp://instagram.com/p/snDLvRr0xf/","2014-09-06 16:28:28+00","132609463487057_721828404565157",1],[1064,"#ItalianGP #Monza #TeamLH - Photo by Steve Etheringtonhttp://instagram.com/p/slMfkkL0y3/","2014-09-05 23:21:40+00","132609463487057_721490897932241",1],[1065,"#Monza #TeamLH #ItalianGP -photos by steve etherington http://instagram.com/p/skiQV_L09n/","2014-09-05 16:53:51+00","132609463487057_721348774613120",1],[1073,"Press conference selfie. #Monza #ItalianGP http://instagram.com/p/sh6pxVr00U/","2014-09-04 16:35:55+00","132609463487057_720764821338182",1],[1035,"That was one of the most exciting qualifying sessions I can remember. I lost a lot of time at the beginning of my last lap and at that point I thought pole was lost. \n\nBut I just kept going and managed to pull some time back. As a driver, through the weekend you plan to have the last lap in qualifying as your best. By that time the track has improved and you should have the settings as close to their optimum as they're going to get. \n\nBut there was so much happening out there and I was just trying not to look at what was going on around me. I was surprised by how close everyone was - the Red Bulls and Ferraris looked quick all day - and it was really fun to be a part of that session. \n\nThe team have done a fantastic job to bring the car here, to a circuit where downforce is so important, and be at the front once again, so a big thank you to them. It's going to be a tough race tomorrow. Coming into the weekend we had an opinion about how the tyres would behave, but the long runs yesterday changed all that. \n\nTrying to manage them will be a big challenge but hopefully it will be an entertaining one for the fans. I'm on the clean side of the track so I'm hoping for a clean start and a strong race. #SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS","2014-09-20 16:21:15+00","132609463487057_729571690457495",1],[1037,"#letsdothis #SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tIpFFMr00S/","2014-09-19 17:22:35+00","132609463487057_729054033842594",1],[1039,"Nico looks very quick, as do the Ferraris and the Red Bulls, but I'm feeling good this weekend and I'm focused on the job #SingaporeGP #TeamLH MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS http://instagram.com/p/tIo8XQL00F/","2014-09-19 17:22:27+00","132609463487057_729053953842602",1],[1041,"Great to meet some fans before the weekend starts!

I didn't fully understand what had happened until I saw the replay just now, but I gave him plenty of space, took the corner like I usually do and suddenly felt a big hit from behind. There was nothing I could do about it and that was effectively my race over. I wanted to retire the car early - not because I was giving up, but because I couldn't catch the people in front of me and even with a safety car I don't think I would have been able to pass them. The car was quite badly damaged and my thoughts were to preserve the engine after the last one was destroyed in Hungary. What happens next is not my call - that's one for the bosses to make. But I'm now almost 30 points behind in the Championship so that's the main thing on my mind. It's a big gap and it will be hard to recover from here.

I can't express the pain I feel when we have issues such as in the last couple of races; it's hard to swallow and difficult to come back the next day and get the right balance between not attacking too much, but pushing to the limit. The two safety car periods helped quite a lot, but naturally I looked fast and had the pace this weekend, so there was an opportunity for more points. I was in the same race as Nico and if I let him past and he had the opportunity to pull away, then he would have come back and overtaken me. I didn't understand why the team asked me to do that as he didn't get close enough to overtake and I didn't want to lift off and lose ground to Fernando. I would like to say a big congratulations to Daniel and Fernando. It was close at the end and it was getting very hard to keep Nico behind as he was catching at close to 3 seconds a lap. Coming back through shows how great this car and team is, and this result is much more satisfying than an easy win.

It's one where you can really attack, which works for an attacking driver like myself, so perhaps it suits my driving style a little bit more than some others. \n\nI've always had great support there from the fans too, so I'm looking forward to it.

From a personal point of view, I can't be too ecstatic about the race because it has been a tough weekend for me and I've ultimately lost more points to Nico in the championship battle. But I'm grateful that I could limit the damage with a podium finish. When you are sitting on the grid basically in last place, with no other cars in your mirrors, it's very hard to imagine that you could be standing up there two hours later. I'm so grateful to the team for this car, I really take my hat off to them for building a machine that can put in that kind of performance. To be honest, it was a pretty straightforward race for me, although I had some trouble following what was going on and where I was running at times. I had a nice battle with Kimi early on, when I was lucky not to damage the front wing, then the incident with Jenson was just unfortunate. He has been such a gentleman this year and not given me too much trouble getting past but it was just a misunderstanding today. I wasn't close enough to try and pass but I was on the inside line in the corner. It looked like he had gone wide, then he cut back across the corner and perhaps he didn't see me there. I lost quite a bit of downforce with the damage and it made it very hard to look after the front left tyre. I had a lot of understeer and the tyre was degrading fast, which is the reason why we converted from a two-stop strategy to three. Then the team called me in early on the first set of option tyres because we expected a Safety Car to come out - and I was surprised that there wasn't one, to be honest I caught Valtteri pretty fast in the final laps but he just had too much straightline speed to get past. I'm doing absolutely everything I can to get back on level terms with Nico in the title battle: I can't focus more or work harder than I am doing right now. This championship is proving a big challenge for me but that's how I love it - and I wouldn't have it any other way.","2014-07-20 20:14:12+00","132609463487057_693262954088369",1],[1179,"#germangp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/qqgsDKr01G/","2014-07-20 07:39:53+00","132609463487057_692944660786865",1],[1180,"#germangp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/qqgr7br01F/","2014-07-20 07:39:51+00","132609463487057_692944610786870",1],[1158,"#hungariangp #hungaroring #teamlh / phot by steve etherington.http://ift.tt/1noYMLC","2014-07-25 16:10:57+00","132609463487057_696059347142063",1],[1160,"#hungariangp #hungaroring #teamlh - photos by steve etherington","2014-07-25 16:10:26+00","132609463487057_696058680475463",1],[1162,"We struggled with poor grip on track today.

We really do have the greatest fans here and thank you so much to everyone for your patience after yesterday. To see the support all around the track is just amazing. I said before that I'd never give up but it was a tough qualifying and I really needed to dig deep and come back positive this morning. A huge thank you to my family and all of the fans for pushing me on - I couldn't have done it without them. Nico had a pretty big gap at the beginning of the race but I kept pushing and was happy with my pace. After extending my first stint, we switched to the prime tyres and I honestly couldn't believe the pace that I had and was closing up to Nico. Of course, he then had a problem and I saw him pull over. It's a shame for the team and I never want to see a team-mate fall behind - I always want to battle it out - but I'm sure we will get to do it again in the future. It's been a rollercoaster weekend and to come away with the win after a day like yesterday is fantastic, so thank you to everyone in the team for all their hard work. I'm proud to have done it for them here - so close to our factories in Brackley and Brixworth.","2014-07-06 17:32:34+00","132609463487057_684750168272981",1],[1223,"#britishgp #silverstone #teamlh - photo by steve etherington http://instagram.com/p/qFECC9r00j/","2014-07-05 18:35:46+00","132609463487057_684088785005786",1],[1225,"#silverstone #teamlh #britishgp - photo by steve etherington http://instagram.com/p/qFD2y0L00X/","2014-07-05 18:35:42+00","132609463487057_684088748339123",1],[1226,"I made a mistake today, a bad call that decided my qualifying.

I have had the pace in the car all weekend here but I wasn't able to capitalise on that, so getting second place from a bad weekend is pretty good, I guess. I had a rocket start - it's something we've be working hard on all year and it was one of the best I've ever had. You can't ever plan what's going to happen but I managed to put the car in all the right places and climb to P4 by the end of the first lap. We were managing the brakes a lot today, because I was in traffic for most of the race and it was the most important thing to bring the car home, so that was a real balancing act. But the strategy worked really well for me to get into second position, then I tried to start pushing Nico - but he didn't make any mistakes and I didn't have the chance to overtake. The guys did a fantastic job today to get us another one-two and the fans here in Austria have been insane. Next race is in Silverstone and all the positive energy from my home fans; it will be a special time and I'll be going all out for the win.","2014-06-22 15:40:04+00","132609463487057_676320619115936",1],[1279,"#austriangp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/pg8GspL0zC/","2014-06-21 17:54:12+00","132609463487057_675732252508106",1],[1281,"#austriangp #teamlh http://instagram.com/p/pgvNyOL06s/","2014-06-21 15:57:37+00","132609463487057_675653889182609",1],[1283,"My 1st lap in Q3 was looking good; I went wide in the second-to-last corner \u0026 I think that lap would probably have done it http://instagram.com/p/pgu6YYL06Q/","2014-06-21 15:57:29+00","132609463487057_675653792515952",1],[1285,"#AustrianGP Practice read here! - http://www.lewishamilton.com/post/austrian-gp-practice/","2014-06-20 15:25:52+00","132609463487057_675002449247753",1],[1287,"Good Practice session today!

There was nothing I could do about our issues really. We were managing the loss of power but as soon as I finally made the jump on Nico in the second pit stop, my brakes failed going into turn 10. It's great for the team that Nico was able to hold on and get second place today but it's tough for me. That's two DNFs now this season and now I have to try and recover the points gap again.

You're always trying to find the limit so we're not quite where we want to be yet.

We completed a lot of practice starts and tried a few different things with the car during the afternoon once the track dried out a bit. Of course, test days aren't as much fun as a race but it's part of the job. It's important for the team and it's also been productive for me in terms of getting the car where I want it after struggling at times last weekend. Conditions were obviously very different but we got some dry running in and I felt happier with the car by the end of the day. Every lap you do in the car you learn a little bit more and these in-season tests are useful given the limited running time we have. Although we have a good advantage right now, the moment we stand still our rivals will be ready to pounce so we have to stay on our toes at all times. I've got a busy week leading up to Monaco but I'll be doing some work back at the factory before that weekend. It's a massively demanding circuit and with the oversteer moments created by the extra torque from the cars this year we'll have to watch our proximity to the walls much more closely. Every driver loves going to Monaco and I'm aiming to keep up the positive momentum from the last four races.","2014-05-13 17:28:31+00","132609463487057_652677411480257",1],[1443,"My mascot last weekend, got to hang out with this little guy, my new nephew. #family #blessed #godisthegreatest #teamLH http://instagram.com/p/n6Sjj-r0-b/","2014-05-12 21:10:03+00","132609463487057_652095538205111",1],[1446,"Good solid test today! #teamlh Photo by www.SteveEtherington.com http://instagram.com/p/n8gFOVL04D/","2014-05-13 17:35:45+00","132609463487057_652680614813270",1],[1447,"Hi guys, lots and lots of pics from the weekend for you today!!

This car is just unbelievable; in the final laps, I was pushing a little bit more to keep up the tyre temperatures and it just felt great to drive. I'm so, so happy today. We had to make a lot of changes after P2 in terms of the set-up of the car but after it rained on Saturday, we didn't know exactly how it would go today. There was a lot of hard work done, sitting down with the engineers so that we didn't guess anything and just made the right steps in anticipation for today.

It's an honour to fight for your place amongst them and a real test of your skills behind the wheel. The last few races have been just incredible. I honestly never expected I'd win four consecutive Grands Prix in my career and I'd love to continue that run here. I've had some work to do in terms of getting the car exactly as I want it after the weekend in Spain: it was so close between our cars at the end and I need to keep pushing to find any extra edge I can. The car has been strong at every race so far and I'm sure it'll be the same in Monaco, so we should be set for an entertaining weekend.","2014-05-16 13:27:23+00","132609463487057_654298797984785",1],[1444,"Watching toy story 3 #family http://instagram.com/p/n6TOdwr0_b/","2014-05-12 21:10:07+00","132609463487057_652095571538441",1],[1445,"Hi Guys, check out the new look of http://www.lewishamilton.com/\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nPhoto by www.SteveEtherington.com","2014-05-14 09:47:24+00","132609463487057_653025311445467",1],[1448,"","2014-05-12 09:43:10+00","132609463487057_651800031567995",1],[1450,"Such a great day!

Nico had a strong P3 and first two sessions of qualifying, so we were making small adjustments to the differential to try and make improvements to how the car was handling for Q3. On that final, run I had to eke out everything and more from the car and myself to get pole and I'm so happy I managed it. The hard work from the team and the development step we have made this weekend are totally inspiring for me - I haven't experienced this level of performance before.

Our two practice sessions today went very smoothly, in fact I've not had such a good Friday for a very long time! Barcelona is a difficult circuit in terms of the tyres so our running was all about trying to see how long the tyres would last and we were able to make some positive changes with that during P2 this afternoon. It's very difficult to overtake here so we will do everything we can to qualify as high as possible tomorrow, but really it is all about the race and looking after those tyres is the most important thing.

I'm in a really good place at the moment and walking around the garage too, you can see the positive energy within the team right now. Everyone is focused on getting the maximum from these early races and continuing to build beyond the strong start we've made to the season. I've had some ups and downs in China. On one side I've only finished outside of the podium places twice at this circuit. On the other, in my first season in Formula One I threw away a championship lead here by going into the gravel coming into the pits. Generally, though, I'm getting stronger every time I come to this track and it suits my driving style quite well.

That was a really tough race tonight and I am absolutely delighted to have come home with the win. It's a long time since I had a race like that! My weekend started off well but I didn't really have great pace for qualifying and the race. I knew that I needed a good start and to go into the first corner in the lead was crucial to my race this evening. From there, it was such a battle. Nico drove fantastically well and, in all honesty, he had the pace on me today but I managed to hold on. I knew when the safety car came out that Nico would be on the option tyres and that he would be quick. To try and stay ahead of him was so hard and when I came across the line I was just so relieved. When you're racing your team-mate, the pressure is really intense and we both knew that we had to bring the cars home for the team and for the championship. All credit to the team for allowing us to race and I hope the fans loved the show that we were able to put on tonight. A big thank you to the team, especially to my engineers for all the information they were giving me during the race, and to everyone here and back at the factories for all their hard work. Another one-two is just fantastic for us. I'm also very proud to have joined Fangio with 24 Grand Prix wins today, he's one of the great racers of all time so that's a real honour.","2014-04-06 19:47:45+00","132609463487057_630910966990235",1],[1522,"#bahraingp #teamlh www.steveetherington.com http://instagram.com/p/mZgr-_L0w0/","2014-04-05 07:08:50+00","132609463487057_630014370413228",1],[1524,"It's been a pretty decent day for us.

The softs in particular seem to be working well and we saw a fair difference in lap time between them and the mediums. The focus today was on the second session as the timing and conditions reflects that of the rest of the weekend and the difference in temperature between the sessions was quite large. The key was to not react too much to that change in terms of our approach to set-up and we seemed to manage that well. It was great driving under the spotlights here: the circuit looks even better at night and you don't really notice a difference in terms of visibility. It's actually quite nice to be driving in cooler conditions too. As always there are still some tweaks we can make to improve the car, but overall I'm feeling good.

It's great to see Mercedes leading the championship but we know that we have to make these early races pay. Anything can happen as we saw in Australia, so this is an important result for us.

We got a nice foundation for the weekend in the second session today so hopefully we can build on that in P3 tomorrow afternoon and then see where we are in qualifying.","2014-03-14 09:05:42+00","132609463487057_618468441567821",1],[1574,"#australiangp #melbourne #stillirise http://instagram.com/p/lez7DoL08e/","2014-03-13 11:47:33+00","132609463487057_618025014945497",1],[1576,"#44 #australiangp #melbourne #stillirise http://instagram.com/p/lezsQkr08R/","2014-03-13 11:47:28+00","132609463487057_618024974945501",1],[1578,"This boys a champ!!

It's been a fantastic week for the team. We've put a lot of laps on the car which is a huge accomplishment. It's a bit early to say this definitely, but right now the car feels pretty good. Like every year we've got a lot of work to do; it's a new challenge this season and the workload is maybe a bit higher than in previous years, but it's a new experience for everyone and I'm enjoying it. This week has just been about getting the mileage on the car and we've managed to do that quite successfully, which is really encouraging as reliability is the biggest positive we could hope to take away from here. So far so good; now we just have to continue working hard and see what happens in Bahrain.","2014-01-31 17:10:11+00","132609463487057_595365670544765",1],[1649,"A little update from today. At the moment we're definitely happy. We've shown the strength within this team through all the hard work that's gone into getting the car here, bouncing back from the issue on Tuesday and then going out there and following up 97 laps yesterday with a further 62 today; it's a huge accomplishment for everyone involved. Proving reliability at this stage is crucial and every lap is precious, as this is going to be a seriously challenging year for every team. I'm feeling very positive after these tests and every day on track is another step forwards, but there are so many challenges ahead of us in the coming weeks and months that we just have to take those steps one at a time.","2014-01-30 17:15:07+00","132609463487057_594853560595976",1],[1651,"Testing again today! #letsdothis","2014-01-30 10:23:19+00","132609463487057_594671303947535",1],[1653,"#classichttp://instagram.com/p/jvzNApL0zv/","2014-01-29 09:05:28+00","132609463487057_594157917332207",1],[1655,"For me it's an incredibly positive start to be the first car out on track and completing a good number of laps. Other teams have been going out for single-lap runs, starting a few hours after we had first hit the track, so to have started running through our test programme was very encouraging. The car feels quite good, especially considering it's so early in our programme, so overall it's been a positive day. Of course, it's unfortunate to end the day early when everyone has worked so hard and we had looked like easily completing the most mileage of anyone here today, but we'll make that track time back and it's better to have these things happen now than in Melbourne. I'm really proud of the team for what they've achieved in getting us here and we'll keep pushing.","2014-01-28 14:01:53+00","132609463487057_593718160709516",1],[1657,"Monaco night lights!! #balconyview #noplacebetterhttp://instagram.com/p/jpMvSjL08C/","2014-01-26 19:35:41+00","132609463487057_592847504129915",1],[1659,"#beachlifehttp://instagram.com/p/jpLpnKr05x/","2014-01-26 19:35:28+00","132609463487057_592847274129938",1],[1662,"http://ift.tt/KVb11O","2014-01-25 17:47:31+00","132609463487057_592344784180187",1],[1664,"Family shot:) #lovemydogs #loyalfriends #blessedhttp://instagram.com/p/jj9wSLL032/","2014-01-24 18:41:17+00","132609463487057_591854340895898",1],[1665,"Newest member to our pit crew, he's got the strength but we may struggle leaving the pit lane because roscoe just wants to play with the tyres","2014-01-23 19:24:04+00","132609463487057_591361127611886",1],[1667,"Hope you had a blessed day!!http://ift.tt/KM5tXb","2014-01-23 18:59:33+00","132609463487057_591348614279804",1],[1669,"#dogboss #swag #shadeshttp://instagram.com/p/jg1ilor08R/","2014-01-23 13:53:55+00","132609463487057_591220677625931",1],[1671,"Met Victoria secret model @adrianalima \u0026 @ronanofficial with his lady last night. #goodpeople #goodtimes #iwchttp://instagram.com/p/jd6o6iL064/","2014-01-22 10:17:22+00","132609463487057_590550944359571",1],[1675,"#bosshttp://instagram.com/p/jdf2mtr07X/","2014-01-22 06:41:23+00","132609463487057_590504374364228",1],[1677,"Representing IWC Watches in Geneva!! #swag","2014-01-21 17:26:27+00","132609463487057_590250781056254",1],[1679,"Really looking forward to today!

I thought that I had moved to the left, he outbraked me and then we touched but it happened so quickly and it was obviously judged that I did something wrong. I was having a good race until that point in fourth place and a podium might have been possible as I was closing on Fernando. That's why I'm so disappointed with my own race but of course I'm delighted for the team. They have done an incredible job this year and really deserve this result. It's the reward for what I know has been many years of hard work and my thoughts are with everyone here at the track and back at our factories at Brackley and Brixworth.

We had to give up third place to Mark fairly easily to make sure our tyre management and strategy worked as it was more important for the team to finish ahead of Ferrari. There was no way I was letting Fernando past at the end; I was ready for him to make his move and had a couple of tenths ready to pull out if he did!

The track was completely different from the final practice session this morning and it was really gusty round the back which affected our car quite a lot.

The circuit was quite green today, which made it pretty slippery out there as we are using the two hardest tyre compounds this weekend. After we changed the chassis yesterday, the car felt better to drive, particularly on the long run when it was pretty consistent, so that's a positive for me. The option tyre is working well for a long stint, which may open up some possibilities for us with race strategy. It was a pretty straightforward day although we still have some work to do to nail the set-up because it's not quite there yet. But all of us in the team are focused on ending the season on a high and taking that foundation with us into the winter.","2013-11-15 22:45:26+00","132609463487057_556567221091277",1],[1754,"I'm really looking forward to returning to Austin this weekend.

The track itself is a lot of fun and a real challenge to get the perfect lap. The high-speed changes of direction combined with the long straights and slower sections make it quite tricky to find the right set-up and balance.

It wasn't his fault at all, just one of those things that wasn't meant to be this afternoon. I feel most gutted for the team - the guys here at the track and in the factory - because they are doing an amazing job right now and we're just not getting the reward for it.

When that happens, you start losing temperature, understeering and locking up under braking, so it was really hard to maintain the pace in those laps. It was a really difficult part of the race but I had to get to a certain target lap before I made the final stop. After the Safety Car, we were just losing out in traction to the Sauber.

Suzuka is one of the few circuits we have left in Formula One with the authenticity of a real old-school circuit. I drove there for the first time in 2009 and it takes a while to pick up pace each year because of how fast-flowing it is. If you touch the grass at any point, it's going to spin you off into the wall, so it's a much more demanding circuit in terms of precision, positioning and turning points for each corner. It's a real race track where you have to think ahead as a driver and it just needs crazy levels of downforce from the car.

It's quite a testing circuit and you need to work the car hard the whole way round the lap to make the most of the tight corners and braking zones. We've had a tough couple of weekends in Belgium and Italy but I know that everyone at the team is determined to bounce back from here and make the most of the opportunities over the last seven races of the season.","2013-09-17 10:05:40+00","132609463487057_526055340809132",1],[1811,"","2013-09-09 11:04:50+00","132609463487057_522105091204157",1],[1814,"I just didn't get a lap together in Q2 today and it's hugely disappointing, not just for me, but also for the team and I can only apologise to them as we had a quick car today.

But Seb just caught me on the run out of Eau Rouge and there wasn't really much I could do to defend: I moved once, like we are allowed to, but then I just had to watch him glide by. From that point, it was very difficult to hold on to him, and the same thing happened with Fernando, too, later in the race. We have done a good job this weekend but Spa and Monza are always unique tracks because of the low-drag requirements and I expect we will be more competitive in Singapore again.
