Sec. Clinton opposes this extremely important measure.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt signed the Glass-Steagall Act into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton. That is unacceptable and that is why Bernie will fight to sign the Warren-McCain bill into law.","2016-04-06 16:22:47+00","124955570892789_1023477974373873",1],[204,"We now know, as a result of the ‘Panama Papers,' that more than 214,000 entities throughout the world have been using a law firm in Panama to avoid paying taxes.\n\nThe Panama Free Trade Agreement put a stamp of approval on Panama, a world leader when it comes to allowing the wealthy and the powerful to avoid taxes. I was opposed to the Panama Free Trade Agreement from day one. I predicted that the passage of this disastrous trade deal would make it easier, not harder, for the wealthy and large corporations to evade taxes by sheltering billions of dollars offshore. I wish I had been proven wrong about this, but it has now come to light that the extent of Panama’s tax avoidance scams is even worse than I had feared.\n\nMy opponent, on the other hand, opposed this trade agreement when she was running against Barack Obama for president in 2008. But when it really mattered she quickly reversed course and helped push the Panama Free Trade Agreement through Congress as Secretary of State. The results have been a disaster.\n\nThe American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election.\n\nIt is time for real change. As president, I will use my authority to terminate the Panama Free Trade Agreement within six months.

During the debate over the Panama trade deal in 2011, Senator Sanders said on the floor of the Senate: \"Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens. And the Panama Free Trade Agreement would make this bad situation much worse ... The trade agreement with Panama would effectively bar the United States from cracking down on illegal and abusive offshore tax havens in Panama.

Please spread the truth:\n\n(1) Bernie’s proposals would cost less than what we’d spend without them. Most of the “cost” the Journal comes up with—$15 trillion—would pay for opening Medicare to everyone. This would be cheaper than relying on our current system of for-profit private health insurers that charge you and me huge administrative costs, advertising, marketing, bloated executive salaries, and high pharmaceutical prices. (Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, estimates a Medicare-for-all system would actually save all of us $10 trillion over 10 years).\n\n(2) The savings from Medicare-for-all would more than cover the costs of the rest of Bernie’s agenda—tuition-free education at public colleges, expanded Social Security benefits, improved infrastructure, and a fund to help cover paid family leave – and still leave us $2 trillion to cut federal deficits for the next ten years.\n\n(3) Many of these other “costs\" would also otherwise be paid by individuals and families -- for example, in college tuition and private insurance. So they shouldn't be considered added costs for the country as a whole, and may well save us money.\n\n(4) Finally, Bernie’s proposed spending on education and infrastructure aren’t really “spending” at all, but investments in the nation’s future productivity. If we don’t make them, we’re all poorer.\n\nThat Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal would do this giant dump on Bernie, based on misinformation and distortion, confirms Bernie's status as the candidate willing to take on the moneyed interests that the Wall Street Journal represents.

Violent crime arrests plummeted - Washington Post:\n\nIn a year full of distressing stories — especially about race, crime and violence in urban neighborhoods — this one points to some hope. Earlier this December, we covered a summer jobs program in Chicago that appeared to lead to fewer teenage arrests for violent crime. Our original story, republished below, also reminds us that policy solutions are possible — and possibly even inexpensive.\n\nA couple of years ago, the city of Chicago started a summer jobs programfor teenagers attending high schools in some of the city's high-crime, low-income neighborhoods. The program was meant, of course, to connect students to work. But officials also hoped that it might curb the kinds of problems — like higher crime — that arise when there's no work to be found.\n\nResearch on the program conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and just published in the journal Science suggests that these summer jobs have actually had such an effect: Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program had 43 percent fewer violent-crime arrests over 16 months, compared to students in a control group.\n\nThat number is striking for a couple of reasons: It implies that a relatively short (and inexpensive) intervention like an eight-week summer jobs program can have a lasting effect on teenage behavior. And it lends empirical support to a popular refrain by advocates: \"Nothing stops a bullet like a job.\"\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/26/chicago-gave-hundreds-of-high-risk-kids-a-summer-job-violent-crime-arrests-plummeted/","2014-12-28 16:46:31+00","124955570892789_766245140097159",1],[1447,"","2014-12-22 16:11:00+00","124955570892789_762010140520659",1],[1449,"","2014-12-21 17:00:00+00","124955570892789_761895803865426",1],[1451,"","2014-12-18 16:28:01+00","124955570892789_759302890791384",1],[1453,"Bernie speaks before a packed room in Ames, Iowa. #Iowa","2014-12-16 18:58:10+00","124955570892789_758414750880198",1],[1454,"Join Bernie today at noon for a town meeting in Ames, Iowa.

Bernie Sanders, The Huffington Post: \n\nThe American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.\n\nThe long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008, has not been pretty. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth. We have one of the highest childhood poverty rates and we are the only country in the industrialized world which does not guarantee health care for all. We once led the world in terms of the percentage of our people who graduated college, but we are now in 12th place. Our infrastructure, once the envy of the world, is collapsing. \n\nRead Bernie's 12-point list here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/an-economic-agenda-for-am_b_6249022.html","2014-12-04 20:34:37+00","124955570892789_752086444846362",1],[1470,"","2014-12-03 15:02:01+00","124955570892789_751244464930560",1],[1472,"Join Vermont’s independent U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for a town meeting in Ames, Iowa.

Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, white-haired and 73 years old, spoke for about an hour in his gravel-voiced, thick Brooklyn accent. His views are, he said, “a little different than most views.” Sanders denounced the power of the wealthy, advocated for single-payer health care and the public funding of elections — and called for a “political revolution” in America.\n\nThe crowd of mostly-elderly, liberal Iowans seemed to like the senator’s pitch. When Sanders said the top 25 hedge fund managers last year made more money than 425,000 public school teachers, many gasped. When he said Wall Street bankers were “too big to jail,” many clapped. And when he opened the floor for questions, one from a younger audience member, Rachel Antonuccio, led to particularly loud cheers. “I have a very simple question,” she said to Sanders. “Will you please run for president?”\nOnce Sanders quieted the applause, he didn’t give the standard politician’s coy non-response. He admitted that he’s “given thought to” running, saying he was motivated by the “enormous problems” the US faces — but he then quickly veered into his misgivings.\n-\n“I’m not much into hero-worship and all this stuff,” he said. “If somebody like me — or me — became president, there is no chance in the world that anything significant could be accomplished without the active, unprecedented support of millions of people, who would be prepared to make a commitment — the likes of which we have not made!”\n\nRead more: http://www.bernie.org/news/vox-bernie-sanders-vs-billionaires/\n","2014-10-15 14:05:00+00","124955570892789_725492874172386",1],[1543,"Join U.S. Sen.

We banned corporations from donating to campaigns after the scandals of the Gilded Age and imposed stricter limits on donations and expenditures after Watergate.\n\nBut today, those improvements are in serious jeopardy. The Supreme Court struck down a major part of the Voting Rights Act and Congress has yet to pass a fix. Voter ID laws are the new poll taxes. And thanks to years of pressure from conservative activists, five members of the Supreme Court have destroyed more than a century of campaign finance laws.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.bernie.org/news/threat-american-democracy/","2014-09-08 17:45:00+00","124955570892789_707884002599940",1],[1592,"","2014-09-09 14:20:49+00","124955570892789_708280335893640",1],[1594,"Sen.

A typical worker’s compensation grew a measly 10.2 percent over the same period.\n\nThe average CEO compensation at the 350 publicly owned companies with the largest annual revenue in the U.S. last year was $15.2 million, according to the EPI, a left-leaning think tank. That’s a 21.7 percent rise since just 2010.\n\nThese massive increases are fattening CEOs' wallets while those of average Americans look ever leaner. Of all income groups, it's arguably minimum-wage earners who have suffered the most. The federal minimum wage has declined sharply since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation. If it had kept pace with increases in workplace productivity, the federal minimum wage would be $21.72 an hour -- triple what it is today.\n\nMeanwhile, median CEO pay among large public companies broke eight figures for the first time last year, according to a recent Associated Press/Equilar study.\n\nIn 2013, according to the EPI's study, the average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was nearly 296-to-1. That's down from a high of 383-to-1 in the boom years of the 2000s, but up from 193-to-1 in the depths of the recession. \n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/12/ceo-pay-report_n_5484622.html?view=print\u0026comm_ref=false","2014-06-12 21:18:01+00","124955570892789_667548816633459",1],[1677,"","2014-06-11 21:31:33+00","124955570892789_666932846695056",1],[1679,"","2014-06-09 19:27:53+00","124955570892789_665844240137250",1],[1682,"","2014-06-05 23:16:04+00","124955570892789_663988376989503",1],[1684,"Join Bernie here: http://bernie.org/","2014-06-03 15:15:01+00","124955570892789_662802100441464",1],[1686,"Republican Hypocrites: http://youtu.be/QyiVVIVm318","2014-05-29 17:15:00+00","124955570892789_659248640796810",1],[1690,"Veterans Health Care on CNN's Crossfire: http://youtu.be/WcKpDxKLrB8","2014-05-23 10:40:13+00","124955570892789_656964724358535",1],[1692,"Last night Sen.

Never, ever forget that,” Sanders said.\n\nThe independent senator was invited to Northampton by Tim Carpenter, founder of the Progressive Democrats of America, to speak as part of the national organization’s 10th anniversary celebration.

The feisty Senator from Vermont is giving dinner speeches in Iowa, telling journalists he’s “prepared” to campaign, and is deciding whether he wants to compete for the Democratic nomination or take the “radical” step of heading an independent ticket. Assuming he rejects the Naderish option, which would upset many of his admirers who recall the 2000 debacle, a Sanders run could be excellent news for Democrats—in the next presidential race and beyond.\n\nAt a minimum, it would make the Democratic primary about more than the deeds and personality of Hillary the inevitable. Sanders, as eloquent a voice of left-wing populism as exists in the land, would press Clinton to support doubling the current minimum wage, imposing higher taxes on the wealthy, and increasing entitlement payments instead of reducing them in a “grand bargain” with Republicans. He would also push her to explain how she would end the dominion of big money in politics, long one of his signature issues. Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case.  According to multiple polls, these are all popular positions—among independents as well as Democrats. But without a shove from the left, Clinton is likely to stick to a mushy moderation, hoping a lengthy battle inside the GOP will result in a nominee too right-wing for the majority of the electorate to stomach.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.bernie.org/uncategorized/democrats-need-bernie-sanders-run-president-2/","2014-05-23 17:00:01+00","124955570892789_656970701024604",1],[1691,"Progressive Grassroots Movements: http://youtu.be/2QZ8v0QZWlg","2014-05-21 15:15:01+00","124955570892789_655905304464477",1],[1693,"Sen.

When Bernie Sanders announces that he's been thinking about 2016, the same hysteria doesn't hold.\n\nThe senator from Vermont  isn't surprised. Although reporters have always been enamored of his hair -- which starts to resemble Charlton Heston parting a sea when Sanders begins passionately speaking about income inequality or Social Security -- and his gruff unwillingness to tell anecdotes lest you write about his personality rather than his policies, his political ambitions are rarely taken seriously.\n\nWith presidential candidates now relying on raising millions from small donors and big donors — besides having one, two or three outside groups raising millions on the side — a candidate who has made fighting big donors and outside groups part of his platform seems to have pre-written his campaign's death knell. Sanders has never accepted corporate PAC money, and the average donation to his campaign during the first quarter of 2014 was $28.95.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/30/bernie-sanders-for-president-its-the-longest-of-long-shots-but-that-doesnt-mean-he-wont-do-it/?wprss=rss_the-fix\u0026clsrd","2014-05-01 14:00:33+00","124955570892789_646643318724009",1],[1712,"Join Sen.

And it’s a gap that is widening, particularly among women.\n\nMr. Bosworth parsed this data from the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study, a survey that tracks the health and work-life of 26,000 Americans as they age and retire. The data is especially valuable as it tracks the same individuals every two years in what’s known as a longitudinal study, to see how their lives unfold.\n\nThe good news is that men of all incomes are living longer. Yet the data shows that the life expectancy of the wealthy is growing much faster than the life expectancy of the poor.\n\nHere’s the sort of detail this remarkable data set can show. You can look at a man born in 1940 and see that during the 1980s, the mid-point of his career, his income was in the top 10% for his age group. If that man lives to age 55 he can expect to live an additional 34.9 years, or to the age of 89.9. That’s six years longer than a man whose career followed the same arc, but who was born in 1920.\n\nContinue reading here: http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/04/18/the-richer-you-are-the-older-youll-get/","2014-04-20 21:16:06+00","124955570892789_642012462520428",1],[1722,"Who Are the Koch Brothers and What Do They Want? - Sen. Sanders, The Huffington Post:\n\nAs a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process. The results of that decision are clear. In the coming months and years the Koch brothers and other extraordinarily wealthy families will spend billions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates to the Senate, the House, governors' mansions and the presidency of the United States. These billionaires already own much of our economy. That, apparently, is not enough. Now, they want to own the United States government as well.\n\nFour years ago, the Supreme Court handed down the 5-4 ruling in Citizens United vs the Federal Election Commission. A few weeks ago, they announced another horrendous campaign finance decision in McCutcheon vs. FEC giving even more political power to the rich. Now, many Republicans want to push this Supreme Court to go even further. In the name of \"free speech,\" they want the Court to eliminate all restrictions on campaign spending -- a position that Justice Thomas supported in McCutcheon -- and a view supported by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Importantly, as a means of being able to exercise unprecedented power over the political process, this has been the position of the Koch brothers for at least the last 34 years.\n\nThe Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in America, making most of their money in the fossil fuel industry. According to Forbes Magazine, they saw their wealth increase last year from $68 billion to $80 billion. In other words, under the \"anti-business\", \"socialist\" and \"oppressive\" Obama administration, their wealth went up by $12 billion in one year.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/who-are-the-koch-brothers_b_5165995.html ","2014-04-18 15:05:00+00","124955570892789_640826042639070",1],[1724,"Stay up to date with Sen.

Nonetheless, we can all, I think, share his commitment to economic justice and learn from his wise assessment of how modern civilization, in its relentless pursuit of profit and its dependence on “the market” to make final valuations of what is good, has lost touch with the ethical imperatives that should guide our society.

More American seniors were living in poverty last year than in 1972.\n\nIn recent years, while median family income has declined and poverty has increased, the number of millionaires and billionaires has grown at an extraordinary rate.

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I also am especially concerned about the impact this change would have on disabled veterans and their survivors.\n\n“The Senate just last month went on record in opposition to the president’s approach. In poll after poll, the American people are overwhelmingly against cutting Social Security. And organizations representing a broad spectrum of millions of Americans from the AFL-CIO to the American Legion to AARP to NOW have urged the president not to make this terrible mistake.\n\n“This is not a minor tweak, as its proponents contend. Under Obama’s proposal, according to the Social Security Administration, 65-year-old retirees would lose more than $650 a year by their 75th birthday, and more than $1,000 a year would be cut from their benefits once they reach 85. The proposed change would also affect more than 3.2 million disabled veterans receiving disability compensation benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans who started receiving V.A. disability benefits at age 30 would have their benefits reduced by $1,425 a year at age 45, $2,341 at age 55 and $3,231 at age 65. Benefits for more than 350,000 surviving spouses and children would also be cut.\n\n“I remember when Obama said he was concerned about retirees struggling to get by and was unequivocal in his opposition to cutting cost-of-living adjustments. On September 6, 2008, then Sen. Obama spoke to the AARP 50th anniversary convention. ‘John McCain’s campaign has gone even further suggesting that the best answer for the growing pressure on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear. I will not do either.’\n\n“I also hope the president follows up on another suggestion that he made during that campaign and gets behind my legislation to raise the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, extending the life of Social Security for generations to come without the need to cut benefits or raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n“Yes, we must move forward on deficit reduction, but it must not be done on the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in this country.”","2013-04-08 15:15:12+00","124955570892789_484836931571316",1],[2549,"Vote Today!
