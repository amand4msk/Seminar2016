He grew into a great leader of the Liberal Party and a reforming, visionary Prime Minister who laid so many of the foundations for the diverse, multicultural nation we are today.\n\nMalcolm was rather shy and often appeared somewhat aloof (not least because of his great height). But those who knew him well saw a warm, droll and often very exuberant man. \n\nIn office and out of it he showed himself to have a big and compassionate heart. He introduced the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1976 and was a strong campaigner against racism around the world leading the Commonwealth's campaign against white minority rule in Rhodesia and apartheid in South Africa. \n\nMalcolm Fraser’s Government established the Family Court, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Human Rights Commission and our first Freedom of Information legislation. \n\nHe was a passionate believer in multiculturalism and immigration. He enabled large scale migration from Asia, including over 50,000 refugees from Vietnam. He established the Special Broadcasting Service as a multicultural broadcaster. \n\nModern Australia would be very different without his vision and leadership. \n\nAs Petro Georgiou said when he retired from the Parliament in 2010 \"To those who have sought to denigrate Malcolm Fraser I just want to say one thing: Malcolm Fraser's fusion of political toughness, with compassion and social conscience, is simply beyond their comprehension.\"\nHe was a young Prime Minister and had a long retirement enjoying vigorous good health until his recent illness. He continued to play a very active role in public life, never afraid to criticise governments when in his view they fell short.  I was privileged to work closely with him on the Republic Campaign in 1999. \n\nMalcolm was a fierce political warrior, but over the years he set a great example of the importance of reconciliation and remembering the things that unite us. I think all of us were delighted to see the way in which Malcolm and Gough Whitlam became friends in their retirement and found common ground in several causes whether it was defending Fairfax from takeover or advocating an Australian republic. \n\nAbove all he was utterly committed to Australia and its independence and maintained his writing and advocacy on foreign policy right up to his death. A fierce cold warrior during his days in office he became over the years concerned that Australia was too compliant with American foreign policy especially with respect to China.\n\nIndeed his last tweet from 11.20 am on Wednesday this week, little more than a day before he died, was linked to an article about Chinese foreign policy.\n\nWhether one agreed with him or not, in whole or in part, one thing was never in doubt.  Malcolm Fraser was a passionately patriotic Australian with a big, liberal vision for our country and its people.","2015-03-20 00:20:46+00","53772921578_10153254002891579",1],[508,"Deregulation -- not as exciting as DOCSIS 3.1 but also very good for the economy #commsau","2015-03-18 03:56:24+00","53772921578_10153249249351579",1],[512,"The dreaded selfie.

The all electric cars are being made in a huge factory that used to belong to GM and Toyota. It shut down and then four years ago Tesla took it over and it went from being an industrial relic to the home of what many regard as the world's fastest and coolest electric car. And many of the workers at Tesla today are auto workers who had been laid off when the old GM/Toyota plant closed. Tesla has gone from employing 500 people to 11,000 in five years. A reminder of how innovation drives jobs.\n\nWalking through the highly automated assembly lines was inspiring, but nothing matched taking a test drive in the latest Tesla S model. This one has a range of 265 miles (about 480 kms) and accelerate to 100 kph in 3.5 seconds. The key of course is the battery technology which is improving all the time both in terms of cost and energy density. Batteries have the potential to revolutionise the energy market, reducing peaking power requirements, optimising grid utilisation of renewables and in some cases enabling consumers to go off the grid altogether. The excitement of technology in the Bay Area is exhilarating.....but not quite as palpable as the jolt you feel when you hit the accelerator! #commsau","2015-01-28 22:40:18+00","53772921578_10153130182811579",1],[575,"With Postgrad Students from @USSC at @unisydney who are part of the @GDAYUSAofficial programme here in San Francisco","2015-01-28 08:48:54+00","53772921578_10153128877231579",1],[576,"With former U.S Government CIO and now Salesforce VP Vivek Kundra and Jim Green talking about how governments around the world are bringing key services online, making it easier for citizens to engage #commsau","2015-01-28 04:15:17+00","53772921578_10153128546341579",1],[579,"Across Australia, thousands of people are becoming Australian citizens today.  Most of us were born here and arrived red faced and screaming into the world as little Aussies. But our new citizens are paying us the greatest compliment - they are choosing to become Australian citizens.\n\nAnd it is a wise choice.\n\nOur nation is  the home of the world's oldest continuous human culture and the people, our first Australians, whose ancestors have cared for and shaped this land for 40,000 years.\n\nOurs is the most successful multicultural society in the world. No other developed nation has such a large share of its population born overseas and from such a diverse range of cultures and countries.\n\nAnd yet we have managed to develop our Australian community with very little disharmony. We don't have to look very far to see how rare that is in the world today.\n\nAnd this has not been an accident. We are united but diverse because we define our national identity not by reference to a race, a religion or ethnic background. Rather our Australian identity, indeed our character, is founded on a unique mix of enlightened political values.\n\nWe are a democracy, but not one where the winner takes all. We respect the rule of law that applies to the state as much as it does to the citizen. We are an egalitarian, but not a levelling society. We have a deep sense of a fair go and that is why our society is more caring with more equality of opportunity than many others. And we are respectful of others, easy going, with a live and let live attitude that allows us to be both diverse and united.\n\nWe are at once a free and fair society.\n\nSometimes we fall short of those values, but we should not sell ourselves short.  Our Australian values are worth fighting for, wherever they are challenged.  Most of the time we defend our values best by living them every day.\n\nBut during this year especially we should not forget the thousands of Australians who have risked, and are risking, their lives to keep us safe and free.\n\nRelationships which do not just endure, but strengthen, over time are tended with love and mutual respect. And that applies to the relationship we all have with each other as citizens.\n\nFor our finest wealth is not the minerals under the ground, or our dazzling natural environment. It is, literally, each other. Our greatest asset is the people of Australia; our family, our friends, our workmates and the millions of fellow Australians we have never met.\n\nSo this Australia Day, and every day, let us resolve to work to build on the things that unite us; better understand, in order to resolve, the things that divide us and above all remember that the more we love, respect and support each other, the more we honour and strengthen our nation, Australia.\n\nHave a very happy Australia Day!","2015-01-25 22:37:03+00","53772921578_10153123551426579",1],[580,"Lots of little hipsters dancing at #jazzamatz at #sydfest this morning.","2015-01-24 04:50:39+00","53772921578_10153119620731579",1],[581,"15 Megabits Is Not Enough - thanks @simonhackett for again exposing the poor quality of commentary on broadband #commsau","2015-01-16 00:04:47+00","53772921578_10153101831681579",1],[582,"Visiting a newly built fixed wireless tower at Wallabadah in NSW -- the towers will mean residents will go from having very poor ADSL speeds to 25 mbps #NBN #commsau","2015-01-15 02:44:53+00","53772921578_10153099887701579",1],[583,"\"In our business we use cloud applications to manage our OH\u0026S and aircraft maintenance. 4 kms from the exchange our ADSL broadband service was slow and unreliable.
