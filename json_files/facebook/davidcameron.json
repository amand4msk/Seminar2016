We want this government to be different. When we say we will tackle our deepest social problems and extend life chances, we want there to be no no-go areas. That includes the 121 prisons in our country, where our social problems are most acute and people’s life chances are most absent. \n\nOur starting point is this: we need prisons. Some people belong in them – punishment is not a dirty word. But we need a prison system that doesn’t see prisoners as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be harnessed. And the failure of our system today is scandalous. This failure really matters to the public purse, to victims, prison staff and prisoners themselves, who shouldn’t feel that society has totally given up them. \n\nSo we will create six new ‘reform prisons’ this year, with full autonomy over how they operate and spend their budget. And the prison education system will also be completely transformed with full control being given to reform prison governors, while protecting the £130 million per year budget.\n\nWe need wholesale reform and we can demonstrate that with the right reforms, we can make a lasting difference to people in our society.","2016-02-08 15:29:41+00","653092548048400_1124638184227165",8],[8832,"This morning I welcomed world leaders to the Syria conference in London:\n\nA warm welcome to London - and on behalf of my co-hosts Chancellor Merkel, Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Prime Minister Solberg, and His Highness the Amir of Kuwait - thank you for your support today.\n\nWe could not have a stronger gathering to address one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time. World leaders from 30 different countries, delegations from 60. NGOs and Civil society - the majority from within Syria.

And we must continue to work towards that, however difficult it may be.\n\nBut while we pursue a solution to this horrific conflict, we can also take vital steps now which will make a real difference to people's lives both today and long into the future. \n\nWe can provide the help that Syrians need now - with pledges of aid - food and medical supplies - that will quite literally save lives. \n\nWe can provide refugees with the opportunities and skills they need to make a life for themselves and their families in host communities - giving them a viable alternative to remain in the region and equipping them for the day they can eventually return home to rebuild their country.\n\nAnd, critically, we can support those host countries and communities which are showing such enormous generosity in providing refuge to Syrians with no choice but to flee destruction.","2016-02-04 12:41:12+00","653092548048400_1122450467779270",8],[8835,"It is right our whole country stands together today to commemorate the Holocaust and remember the darkest hour of humanity.\n\nThe memorial we are building by Parliament will be a permanent statement of our values as a nation and something for our children to visit for generations to come.","2016-01-27 20:36:17+00","653092548048400_1118339001523750",8],[8838,"Thank you to Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain and Paul Hollywood for judging No. 10's charity Bake Off for Sarcoma UK.

My article for the Sunday Telegraph:\n\nOn 23rd June, nothing less than the future of our country is at stake.\n \nIf you vote to remain in Europe, I can clearly describe what you’re voting for. Our trade links with a reformed Europe and the wider world will grow; we’ll keep on working with our neighbours to make our country safer; and Britain will continue to help set the rules of the market of 500 million people on our doorstep, and have a say over the future of the continent to which we are geographically tied. \n\nThat’s the picture of “in” – positive and definitive.\n \nInstead, when the people campaigning for “out” are asked to set out a vision outside the European Union, they become extremely vague. It’s simply not good enough to assert everything will be alright when jobs and our country’s future are at stake. \n\nThat’s why today I want to set out some of the specific questions those who would leave the European Union must answer. They don’t owe it to me; they owe it to us all, because at the moment what they are offering is a leap in the dark.\n \nThe first question is: what trading relationship would Britain have with Europe after leaving? Every country that’s been granted full access to the Single Market has had to pay into the EU, and accept free movement of people – but has no say over rules that govern those things.\n \nJust ask Norway; they pay roughly the same per head to the EU as Britain does, and they accept twice as many EU migrants, yet they have no say at the EU Council.\n \nAnother suggestion is to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement or similar with the EU, like Canada, Switzerland or Turkey. \n\nBut none of these countries has an agreement that is any way as comprehensive as the Single Market. That’s OK for them – around a tenth of Canada’s exports, for example, go to Europe; but around half of ours do. What’s more, Canada’s agreement, when it takes effect, will offer less access for services than we have now. But that sector makes up three-quarters of our economy. What would that mean for UK jobs in retail, insurance and creative industries?\n \nA final option is to fall back onto the World Trade Organisation for trade. But this could be crippling for our industries, as we’d have to accept tariffs that are sometimes as high as 50 per cent.\n \nThe second question is: how long would it take to put a new relationship in place – and how great would the uncertainty be for families and businesses in the meantime? It took Switzerland a decade to negotiate their current relationship with Europe, and Canada seven years – and theirs still hasn’t been implemented. \n\nOf course, those who advocate leaving Europe say we should just sign trade deals with other parts of the world. But how plausible is it that India, China or Brazil would sign a trade deal with us before they know what sort of new relationship we have with Europe?\n \nWhile all this wrangling goes on, there would be huge amounts of uncertainty, and it would have an impact on investment and trade – and, ultimately, your job, the prices you pay and your family’s finances.\n \nThe third question is about security. Today Britain has a whole set of arrangements with our European neighbours: the European Arrest Warrant, access to European criminal records, sharing information to stop terrorists coming to our country.\n \nDo those who want to leave support this network of security cooperation? If not, they need to spell out how they intend to keep people safe. \n\nDo they propose individual agreements with 27 countries? How long would that take? Or do they propose an agreement with the EU simply to opt back into all of the arrangements again? Surely that would mean – again – we would be subject to rules we would have no power over influencing – the complete opposite of sovereignty.\n \nFourth, there’s a bigger question about our role in the world: outside the EU, is Britain more able or less able to get things done? \n\nOf course, we’re a strong country. We’re the 5th largest economy in the world. We’ve got superb armed forces. But think of the things that have threatened us in recent years: the prospect of a nuclear Iran; Russian aggression in Ukraine; the overwhelming impact of the migration crisis; the poison of Islamist extremism and terrorism.\n \nEuropean countries have to work together to deal with them, and it is through the EU that Britain has helped drive Europe’s response. And they will remain issues if Britain leaves the EU. That doesn’t mean we can’t do things with NATO or with America – but there is a reason that our NATO allies want us to remain in the EU.\n \nThey can see clearly that our membership amplifies our power as a nation, and that now is not a time for disunity among Western nations.\n \nAs you consider these questions, bear in mind the process for leaving the EU, as set out in Article 50 of the European Treaty. A Leave vote would set the clock ticking on a two-year period to negotiate the terms of exit. \n\nIf we failed to reach an agreement, all 27 countries would have to approve an extension, or we’d fall back onto basic rules. That means that, without an extension, our full access to the Single Market ceases and our free trade agreements around the world lapse overnight.\n  \nA year ago, the Conservative election manifesto contained a clear commitment: security at every stage of your life. Britain is doing well. Our economy is growing; unemployment is falling to record lows.\n \nWe need to be absolutely sure, if we are to put all that at risk, that the future would be better for our country outside the EU than it is today.\n \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the only certainty of exit is uncertainty; that leaving Europe is fraught with risk. Risk to our economy, because the dislocation could put pressure on the pound, on interest rates and on growth. Risk to our cooperation on crime and security matters. And risk to our reputation as a strong country at the heart of the world’s most important institutions. \n\nWith so many gaps in the “out” case, the decision is clearly one between the great unknown and a greater Britain. \n\nA vote to leave is the gamble of the century. And it would be our children’s futures on the table if we were to roll the dice.","2016-02-28 10:12:54+00","653092548048400_1136556636368653",8],[8817,"Great to launch ConservativesIn last night.

Instead there is a grown-up country that, despite our challenges, is largely at ease with the diversity of our open society. We also know what we are trying to achieve. Not a process of total assimilation, where people lose their whole identity. Nor is it “separate development” where we encourage — or even tolerate — communities living apart. But instead, we are in the process of building a common home together, where our shared British values should help us to live side by side. And we aim for a land where at last, everyone — no matter their gender, race, background or sexuality — can be accepted for who they are and expect to be treated with true equality.\n\nBut when you look more under the surface, it’s clear that we’ve still got some distance to travel to achieve the One Nation ideal. Consider this: if you’re a young black man, you’re more likely to be in a prison cell than studying at a top university. Only one in 10 of the poorest white boys go into higher education at all. There are no black generals in our armed forces and just 4% of chief executives in the FTSE 100 are from ethnic minorities.\n\nWhat does this say about modern Britain? Are these just the symptoms of class divisions or a lack of equal opportunity? Or is it something worse — something more ingrained, institutional and insidious? We’ve come a long way — including in my own party. When I became an MP in 2001, I barely had a single colleague from an ethnic minority background. Today our MPs include the sons, daughters and grandchildren of Ghanaians, east African Indians, Iranian dissidents, Pakistanis and Indians. But there is much more to do, and these examples I mention should shame our country and jolt us into action.\n\nSo what are we going to do? First, we’ve got to extend life chances. Last month I spoke about the subtle social inequality that can hold people back. It can start with poor parenting, and that damage can then be compounded in a poor or coasting school. And later, in adolescence, young people can lack access to vital, life-enriching experiences, mentors and support networks. We’ve got to think radically here — and with expanded parenting provision, teaching character in schools, and new mentoring and work experience programmes, I think we can rise to the challenge.\n\nBut improving life chances only gets you part of the way there. You can have a great start in life, but still be held back — often invisibly — because of your background or the colour of your skin. So the second thing we need to do is tackle discrimination. I don’t care whether it’s overt, unconscious or institutional — we’ve got to stamp it out. We don’t need politically correct, contrived and unfair solutions. Quotas don’t fix the underlying problems. To succeed, we must be far more demanding of our institutions, and be relentless in the pursuit of creative answers.\n\nOne area we should look at is the criminal justice system. It’s disgraceful that if you’re black, it seems you’re more likely to be sentenced to custody for a crime than if you’re white. We should investigate why this is and how we can end this possible discrimination. That’s why I have asked David Lammy MP to lead a review of the overrepresentation of black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the criminal justice system. And this will include possible sentencing and prosecutorial disparity.\n\nAnother area where we need action is our universities. It’s striking that in 2014, our top university, Oxford, accepted just 27 black men and women out of an intake of more than 2,500. I know the reasons are complex, including poor schooling, but I worry that the university I was so proud to attend is not doing enough to attract talent from across our country. And these problems go deep elsewhere, too: white British men from poor backgrounds are five times less likely to go into higher education than others.\nThere is a real chance to help nudge universities into making the right choices and reaching out in the right ways. For example, there was compelling evidence that people with ethnic-sounding names were less likely to get call-backs for jobs, even with the same qualifications. That’s why, last year, I persuaded universities and many other organisations to introduce name-blind applications.\n\nToday I can announce a further step. We intend to legislate to place a new transparency duty on universities to publish data routinely about the people who apply to their institution, the subject they want to study, and who gets offered a place. And this will include a full breakdown of their gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic background. And to focus minds further, Sajid Javid, the business secretary, will chair a summit tomorrow in Downing Street with schools and universities to help chart other ways forward.\n\nThis is all part of our ambitious “2020 agenda” for BME communities. Not just greater numbers at university, but many more jobs, apprenticeships and start-up loans. And I am determined to fix that stubborn problem of underrepresentation in our police and armed forces. To succeed, I want to issue a great call to arms to institutions all across our country. It’s not enough to simply say you are open to all. Ask yourselves: are you going that extra mile to really show people that yours can be a place for everyone, regardless of background? We can all dig deeper — but I’m confident we can get there. This is Britain; there’s nothing we can’t achieve together.\n\nWe have a claim to be the most successful multiracial, multifaith democracy on Earth. In Britain, the children and grandchildren of migrants sit at the cabinet table, run world-beating companies and win Oscars, Turner prizes and Olympic golds. But our relative success isn’t enough so long as there are young people who don’t feel like there’s a fair chance for them. Discrimination and disadvantage only feed those who preach a message of grievance and victimhood — and that makes building One Nation a harder and longer task. I want this to be the government that finally makes the difference. So let’s ask those big questions. Let’s find the solutions. Let us together finish the fight for real equality in Britain.","2016-01-31 11:39:46+00","653092548048400_1120325857991731",8],[8833,"My thoughts are with Terry Wogan's family.

My article for this morning's The Times:\n\nWhere in the world do you think the following things are happening? School governors’ meetings where male governors sit in the meeting room and the women have to sit out of sight in the corridor. Young women only allowed to leave their house in the company of a male relative. Religious councils that openly discriminate against women and prevent them from leaving abusive marriages.\n\nThe answer, I’m sorry to say, is Britain. Last week, I chaired a meeting of a group of brilliant Muslim women role models. And while I heard great examples of so many women who are flourishing in our country, some painted an alarming picture of forced gender segregation, discrimination and social isolation from mainstream British life.\n\nOf course, this does not describe the life of every British Muslim woman. Nor are these problems unique to Muslim communities. And it cannot be said often enough that the fear of Islamophobic hate crime – for instance, the disgraceful pulling of women’s headscarves in the street – is widespread and incredibly threatening, as well as being completely disempowering for women. But these problems are being consistently brought to our attention by Muslim women, and we have a duty to them to speak out – and to act.\n\nThat must begin by understanding the root causes. Some are, of course, cultural. But the standing rebuke to our society is that we have allowed this to continue. All too often, because of what I would call “passive tolerance”, people subscribe to the flawed idea of separate development. Ed Husain put it brilliantly last week when he said that our political correctness stops us from identifying this separatist mentality – terming it “the racism of low expectations”. It helps explain why, for instance, some so-called progressive politicians see fit to host gender-segregated political meetings.\n\nIt is time to change our approach. We will never truly build One Nation unless we are more assertive about our liberal values, more clear about the expectations we place on those who come to live here and build our country together and more creative and generous in the work we do to break down barriers. And this is a challenge that government cannot meet on its own.  I do want every part of government to play its part – health visitors, job centres, nurseries, schools – but we all have a shared responsibility to tackle prejudice and bigotry, and help integration.  \n\nWhy does this matter so much? Because we don’t just need a strong economy to thrive, we have to build a strong society. Segregation drives us apart, not together. And tolerating the development of parallel communities can also mean failing to get to grips with appalling practices like FGM and forced marriage. \n\nThere is also an important connection to extremism. I am not saying separate development or conservative religious practices directly cause extremism. That would be insulting to many who are devout and peace-loving. But they can help a young person’s slide towards radicalisation. Think about the young boy growing up in Bradford. His parents came from a village in Pakistan. His mum can’t speak English and rarely leaves the home, so he finds it hard to communicate with her, and she doesn’t understand what is happening in his life. At the same time, as a teenager he is struggling to identify with Western culture. Separate development and accepting practices that go against our values only emphasise differences and can help prompt the search of something to belong to. When that happens, the extremist narrative gives him something – however ridiculous – to believe in.\n\nSo what can we do about this? First, we need some clear thinking. This is Britain. In this country, women and girls are free to choose how they live, how they dress and who they love. It’s our values that make this country what it is, and it’s only by standing up for them assertively that they will endure. In Britain, men are not frightened of women’s success; it is celebrated proudly. So we must take on the minority of men who perpetuate these backward attitudes and exert such damaging control over their wives, sisters and daughters. And we must never again allow passive tolerance to prevent us from telling the hard truths.\n\nWe also need a clear and positive policy agenda. So we will review the role of religious councils, including Sharia councils. We’re teaching British values in our schools because I want every young boy and girl growing up here to feel proud of our country and properly connected to it. And we’ll end the forced gender segregation, as we issue clear guidance to local authorities to stamp out this practice. \n\nWe must also make more progress on English language. It is at the heart of solving this. Consider this: new figures show that some 190,000 British Muslim women – or 22 per cent – speak little or no English despite many having lived here for decades. 40,000 of these women speak no English at all. So it’s no surprise that sixty per cent of women of a Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage are economically inactive. \n\nThis has to be tackled head on. We’ve already introduced a language test for new migrants, but I believe it’s time to be much more demanding. Yes, we have responsibilities to migrants, but they have responsibilities too. At the moment, someone can move here with very basic English and there’s no requirement to improve it over time. We will change that. We will now say: if you don’t improve your fluency, that could affect your ability to stay in the UK. This will help make it clear to those men who stop their partners from integrating that there are consequences.\n\nWe’ll also fund a dramatic improvement in the way we provide English language services for women. With a new £20m programme, we’ll make sure every woman from isolated communities with no English at all has access to classes, whether through community groups or FE colleges. \n\nBritain has a claim to be the most successful multi-faith, multi-racial democracy on the planet. We got here because we fought and won those long struggles for liberty, equality and mutual tolerance. But the job of building a more cohesive country is never complete. With English language and women’s empowerment as our next frontier, I believe we can bring Britain together and build the stronger society that is within reach.","2016-01-18 09:03:36+00","653092548048400_1113241935366790",8],[8845,"David Bowie was someone who people of my age, and those quite a bit older, felt we grew up with.

my opening speech in the Commons debate:\n\nMr Speaker, I beg to move the motion on the order paper in my name and that of my Rt Hon Friends.\n\nThe question before the House today is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by ISIL.\n\nAnd Mr Speaker, let me be clear from the outset, this is not about whether we want fight terrorism, it’s about how best we do that.\n\nI respect that governments of all political colours in this country have had to fight terrorism and have had to take the people with them as they do so.\n\nAnd I respect people who come to a different view from the government and from the one I’ll set out in the House today, and those who vote accordingly.\n\nAnd I hope that provides some reassurance to members right across the House.\n\nMr Speaker, in moving this motion, I am not pretending that the answers are simple.\n\nThe situation in Syria is incredibly complex.\nI am not overstating the contribution that our incredible servicemen and women can make.\nNeither am I ignoring the risks of military action...\n...nor am I pretending that military action is any more than one part of the answer.\n\nI am absolutely clear that we must pursue a comprehensive strategy that also includes political, diplomatic and humanitarian action.\n\nAnd I know that the long term solution in Syria - as in Iraq - must ultimately be a government that represents all of its people...\n\n...and one that can work with us to defeat the evil organisation of ISIL for good.\nBut Mr Speaker, notwithstanding all of this, there is a simple question at the heart of the debate today.\n\nWe face a fundamental threat to our security.\n\nISIL have brutally murdered British hostages.\nThey’ve inspired the worst terrorist attack against British people since 7/7 on the beaches of Tunisia…\n…and they’ve plotted atrocity after atrocity on the streets here at home.\nSince November last year our security services have foiled no fewer than seven different plots against our people.\nSo this threat is very real.\n\nAnd the question is this: do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat?\n\nAnd do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands...\n\n...from where they are plotting to kill British people...\n\n...or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?\n\nIn answering this question we should remember that 15 months ago...\n\n...facing a threat from ISIL in Iraq...\n\n...this House voted 524 to 43 to authorise airstrikes in Iraq.\n\nSince then our brilliant RAF pilots have helped local forces to halt ISIL’s advance and recover 30% of the territory ISIL had captured.\n\nOn Monday I spoke to the President of Iraq in Paris and he expressed his gratitude for the vital work our forces are doing.\nAnd yet when our planes reach the border with Syria...\n\n...a border that ISIL themselves do not recognise...\n\n...we can no longer act to defend either his country – or our indeed country.\n\nEven when we know that ISIL’s headquarters are in Raqqah in Syria...\n\n...and it is from here that many of the plots against our country are formed.\n\nMr Speaker, we possess the capabilities to reduce this threat to our security.\n\nAnd my argument today is that we should not wait any longer before doing so.\n\nWe should answer the call from our allies.\n\nThe action we propose to take is legal...\n\n... it is necessary...\n\n...and it is the right thing to do to keep our country safe.\n\nAnd my strong view is House should make clear that our responsibilities rather than pass them off and put our own national security in the hands of others.\n\nNow Mr Speaker, since my Statement last week, the House has had an opportunity to ask questions of our security experts.\n\nI have arranged a briefing for all Members…\n…as well as more detailed briefings for Privy Councillors.\n\nI have spoken further to our allies – including President Obama, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande and the King of Jordan.\nThe King of Jordan has written in The Daily Telegraph today expressing his wish for Britain to stand with Jordan in eliminating this global threat.\n\nI have also listened carefully to the questions asked by Members on all sides of this House...\n\n...and I hope that Hon members can see the influence this House has had on the motion that stands before us.  \n\nThe stress on post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction, the importance of standing by our Allies, the importance of only targeting ISIL, not deploying ground troops in combat operations, to avoid civilian casualties, the importance of ceasefires and a political settlement, a commitment to regular updates to this House.\n\nI’ve drawn these points from across the House and put them in the motion because I want as many people as possible to feel able to support this action.\n\nIn my remarks, I want to address the most important points raised...\n...and I will of course take as many interventions as I can.\n\nMr Speaker, the key questions that have been raised are these.\n\nFirst, could acting in this way actually increase the risk to our security by making an attack on Britain more likely?\n\nSecond, does Britain really have the capability to make a significant difference?\n\nThird, the question asked by a number of Members – including the Hon. Member for Gordon – is why don’t we just increase our level of air strikes in Iraq...\n....to free up capacity amongst other members of the coalition, so they can carry out more air strikes in Syria.\n\nFourth, will there really be the ground forces needed to make this operation a success?\n\nFifth, what is the strategy for defeating ISIL and securing a lasting political settlement in Syria?\n\nAnd sixth, is there a proper reconstruction, post conflict stabilisation plan for Syria?\n\nI want to try in the time I’ve got available to answer all of these in turn.\n\nBut before we get on tot all these things, Mr Speaker, I want to say a word about the terminology we use to describe this evil death cult.\n\nHaving carefully considered the strong representations made to me by the Hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham...\n\n...and having listened to many Members of Parliament from across the House...\n\n...I feel it is time to join our key ally France, the Arab League, and other members of the International community in using as frequently as possible the terminology Daesh rather than ISIL.  \n\nBecause frankly this evil death cult is neither a true representation of Islam nor is it a State.\n\nLet me turn to the important questions.\n\nFirst, could acting increase the risk to our security?\n\nThis is one of the most important questions have to answer.\n\nMr Speaker, Privy Councillors and members from across the House have had a full briefing from the Chair of the independent Joint Intelligence Committee.\n\nObviously I can’t share all the classified material but I can say this.\n\nParis wasn’t just different because it was so close to us, or because it was so horrific in scale; as different because it showed the extent of terror planning from Daesh in Syria and the approach of sending people back from Syria to Europe.\n\nThis was if you like, the head of the snake in Raqqa in action.\n\nSo it’s not surprising in my view that the judgement of the Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee and the judgement of the Director General of the Security Service...\n...is that the risk of a similar attack in the UK is real and that that the UK is already in the top tier of countries on ISIL’s target list.\n\nSo let me be frank Mr Speaker.\n\nIf there is an attack on the UK in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it has happened because of our airstrikes.\n\nI do not believe that would be the case.\n\nDaesh have been trying to attack us for the last year – as we know from the seven different plots that our security services have foiled.\n\nThe terrorist threat level to the UK was raised to Severe last August in the light of the threat from Daesh, meaning an attack is highly likely.\n\n800 people – including families and children – have been radicalised to such an extent that they have travelled to this so-called caliphate.  \n\nThe House should be under no illusion: these terrorists are plotting to kill us, and to radicalise our children, right now.\n\nThey attack us because of who we are, not because of what we do.\n\nBut when it comes to the risks of taking military action...\n...the risks of inaction are far greater thank the risks of what I propose.\n\nNext, there are those who ask whether Britain conducting strikes in Syria will really make a difference.\n\nThis is a question that came up.\n\nI believe we can make a difference.\n\nI told the House last week about our dynamic targeting...\n\n...about our Brimstone missiles, about the RAPTOR pod on our tornadoes, and the intelligence gathering work of our REAPER drones.\n\nBut there is another way of putting this which I think is equally powerful.\n\nThere is, of course, in the coalition a lot of strike capability but when it comes to precision strike capability – whether covering Iraq or Syria – last week, the whole international Coalition had some 26 aircraft available.\n\nEight of those were British Tornadoes.\n\nSo typically, the UK actually represents between a quarter and a third of the international coalition’s precision bombing capability.\n\nAnd we also have about a quarter of the unmanned strike capability flying in the region.\n\nSo we have do have a significant proportion of high precision strike capability.\n\nThat’s why this decision is so important.\n\nSo the argument I was making is one reason why members of the international coalition – including President Obama and President Hollande who made these points to me personally…\n\n...they believe that British planes would make a real difference in Syria, just as they are already doing in Iraq.\n  \nIn many way, what I’ve just said I believe helps to answer the next question that some Members have asked…\n…about why we do not simply increase our level of air strikes in Iraq to free up other coalition capacity for strikes in Syria.\n\nWe have these capabilities that other Members of the Coalition want to benefit from.\n  \nAnd it makes absolutely no sense to stop using these capabilities at a border between Iraq and Syria that Daesh simply do not recognise or respect.\n\nIn fact, there was a recent incident in which Syrian opposition forces needed urgent support in their fight against Daesh.\n\nBritish tornadoes were eight minutes away just over the border in Iraq, no-one else was close.\n\nBut Britain couldn’t help, so the Syrian Opposition forces had to wait 40 minutes in a perilous situation while other Coalition forces were scrambled.\n\nNow that sort of delay, it endangers the lives of those fighting Daesh on the ground and frankly does nothing for our reputation with our vital allies.\n\nThere is a much more fundamental answer as to why we should carry out air strikes in Syria ourselves.\nAnd it’s this.\nIt is Raqqa in Syria that is the Headquarters of this threat to our security.\n\nIt is in Syria where they pump and sell the oil that does so much to help finance their evil acts.\n\nAnd as I’ve said, it is in Syria where many of the plots against our country are formed.\n\nLet me turn to the question of whether there will be the ground forces to make this operation a success.\n\nThose who say there aren’t as many ground troops as we would like...\n\n...and that they are not all in the right place...\n\n...they are correct.\n\nWe are not dealing with an ideal situation but let me make a series of, I think, important points.\n\nFirst, we should be clear what air strikes alone can achieve.\n\nWe don’t need ground troops to target the supply of oil which Daesh uses to fund terrorism.\n\nWe don’t need ground troops to hit Daesh’s headquarters, their infrastructure, their supply routes, their training facilities, their weapons supplies.\n\nIt’s clear that airstrikes can have an effect, as I’ve just said, with the issue of Khan and Hussain.\n\nSo irrespective of ground forces, our RAF can do serious damage to Daesh's ability right now to bring terror to our streets and we should give them our support.\n  \nAs I said last week, the full answer to the question of ground forces can’t be achieved until there is a new Syrian government that represents all the Syrian people...\n\n...not just Sunni, Shia and Alawite, but Christian, Druze and others.\n\nAnd it is this new government who will be the natural partners for our forces in defeating Daesh for good.\n\nBut there are some ground forces that we can work with in the meantime.\n\nLast week I told the House that we believe there are around 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters…\n\n…who do not belong to extremist groups…\n…and with whom we can co-ordinate attacks on Daesh.\nThe House will appreciate there are some limits on what I can say about these groups.\n\nNot least because I can’t risk the safety of these courageous people - who are being targeted daily by the Regime, or by Daesh, or by both.\n\nBut I know this is an area of great interest and concern for the House, so let me try and say a little more.\n\nThe 70,000 is an estimate from our independent Joint Intelligence Committee…\n…based on a detailed analysis, updated on a daily basis, and drawing on a wide range of open source and intelligence.\n\nOf these 70,000, the majority are from the Free Syrian Army.\n\nAlongside the 70,000, there are some 20,000 Kurdish fighters with whom we can also work.\n\nNow I’m not arguing – this is a crucial point – I am not arguing that all of these 70,000 are somehow ideal partners. Some though, left the Syrian army because of Assad’s brutality and they clearly can play a role in the future of Syria.\n\nAnd that is actually a view that is taken by the Russian’s as well, who are prepared to talk to these people.\n\nAnd those figures do not include a further 25,000 actual extremist fighters in groups which reject political participation and any co-ordination with non-Muslims…\n\nSo although they fight Daesh, they cannot and will not be our partners.\n\nBut, Mr Speaker, there are ground forces who will take the fight to Daesh…\n…and in many cases we can work with them and we can assist them.\n\nThird, if we don’t act now, we should be clear that there will be even fewer ground forces over time...\n...as Daesh will get even stronger.\n\nMy view, we simply cannot afford to wait.\n\nLet me turn to our overall strategy.\n\nAgain I set this out in the House last week.\n\nBut let me say a little more about each of the non-military elements....\n...counter-terrorism, counter-extremism, the political and diplomatic process and the vital humanitarian work that my Rt. Hon friend just referred to.\n\nOur counter-terrorism strategy gives Britain a comprehensive plan to prevent and foil plots at home...\n\n...and also to address the poisonous extremist ideology that is the root cause of the threat that we face.\n\nAs part of this I can announce today that we will establish a comprehensive review to root out any remaining funding of extremism within the UK.\n\nThis will examine specifically the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK...\n\n...including any overseas sources.\n\nAnd it will report to myself and My Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary next Spring.\n\nMr Speaker, I know there are some who suggest that military action could in some way undermine our counter-extremism strategy by radicalising British Muslims.\n\nSo let me take this head on.\n\nBritish Muslims are appalled by Daesh.\n\nThese women-raping, Muslim-murdering, mediaeval monsters - are hijacking the peaceful religion of Islam for their warped ends.\n\nAs the King of Jordan says in his article today:  these people are not Muslims they are outlaws from Islam.\n\nAnd we must stand with our Muslim friends here and around the world as they reclaim their religion from these terrorists.\n\nSo far from an attack on Islam...\n\n...we are engaged in a defence of Islam.\n\nAnd far from a risk of radicalising British Muslims by acting...\n\n...failing to act would actually be to betray British Muslims and the wider religion of Islam in its very hour of need.\n\nThe second part of our strategy is our support for the diplomatic and political process.\n\nLet me say a word about how this process can lead to the ceasefires between the Regime and Opposition that are so essential for the next stages of this political transition.\n\nIt begins with identifying the right people to put around the table.\n\nNext week we expect the Syrian regime to nominate a team of people to negotiate under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nOver the last 18 months political and armed opposition positions have converged.\n\nWe know the main groups and their ideas.\n\nAnd in the coming days Saudi Arabia will host a meeting for Opposition representatives in Riyadh.\n\nAnd the United Nations will take forwards discussions on steps towards a ceasefire...\n\n...including at the next meeting of the International Syria Support Group which we expect to take place before Christmas.\n\nThe aim is clear as I’ve said, a transitional government in six months, a new constitution and free elections within 18 months so I would argue that the key elements of a deal are emerging.\n\nCeasefires, opposition groups coming together, the regime looking at negotiations, the key players – America and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran and key regional players like Turkey all in the room together.\n\nAnd my argument is this, hitting Daesh doesn’t hurt this process, it helps this process which is the eventual goal.\n\nI set out for the House last week our support for refugees in the region…\n\n...and the extra £1 billion that we would be prepared to commit to Syria’s reconstruction...\n\n...and the broad international alliance that we would work with in that rebuilding phase.\n\nBut Mr Speaker, let us be clear.\n\nPeople will not return to Syria, if part of it is under the control of an organisation that enslaves Yazidis...\n\n...throws gay people off buildings...\n\n...beheads aid workers...\n\n...and forces children to marry before they are even 10 years old.\n\nSo we cannot separate the humanitarian work and the reconstruction work from dealing with Daesh itself.\n\nLet me turn in more detail to the plan for post conflict reconstruction to support a new Syrian government when it emerges.\n\nI have said we would be prepared to commit at least £1 billion to Syria’s reconstruction.\n\nThe initial priorities would be protection, security, stabilisation and confidence building measures...\n\n...including meeting basic humanitarian needs, such as education, health and shelter, and of course helping refugees to return.  \n\nNow over time the focus would shift to longer-term rebuilding of Syria’s shattered infrastructure...\n\n...harnessing the expertise of the International Financial Institutions and the private sector.\n\nAs I said last week, we are not in the business of trying to dismantle the Syrian state, or its institutions.\n\nWe would aim to allocate reconstruction funds against a plan agreed between a new inclusive Syrian government and the international community, once the conflict has ended.\n\nThat is the absolute key.\nMr Speaker, let me conclude. This is not 2003.\n\nWe must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction.\n\nAnd let’s be clear Mr Speaker, inaction does not amount to a strategy for our security or for the Syrian people.\n\nBut inaction is a choice. I believe it’s the wrong choice.\n\nWe face a clear threat.\n\nWe have listened to our allies.\n\nWe have taken legal advice.\n\nWe have a unanimous United Nations Resolution.\n\nWe have discussed our proposed action extensively at meetings of the National Security Council and Cabinet.\n\nI have responded personally to the detailed report of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\n\nWe have a proper motion before the House.\n\nAnd we are having a ten and a half hour debate today.\nNow in that spirit I look forward to the rest of the debate...\n\n...I look forward to listening to the contributions of Members on all sides of the House.\n\nBut I hope that at the end of it all...\n\n...the House will come together in large numbers for Britain to play its part in defeating these evil extremists...\n\n...and taking the action that is needed now to keep our country safe.\n\nIn doing so, I pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery and service of our inspirational armed forces....\n\n...who will once again put themselves in harm’s way to protect our values and our way of life.\n\nAnd I commend this motion to the House.","2015-12-02 14:13:04+00","653092548048400_1088361564521494",8],[8876,"Today's Autumn Statement delivers our election commitments.

And it all comes back to one word: security. I want this to be the decade in which we deliver the economic security that working people and British businesses need to flourish; and in which our national security is preserved as we strengthen our defences and defeat the scourge of Islamist extremism for good.\n\nThere’s another crucial dimension to our plans: social reform — bringing security to families who currently have none. As I said three months ago in Manchester, a central part of my second-term agenda is to wage an all-out assault on poverty and disadvantage. And tomorrow I will set out our plan to extend life chances across Britain and really get to grips with the deep social problems — the blocked opportunity, poor parenting, addiction and mental health problems — that mean so many are unable to fulfil their potential.\n\nThere’s one issue that brings together many of these social problems and, for me, epitomises both the scale of the challenge we face and the nature of state failure over decades. It’s our housing estates. Some of them, especially those built just after the war, are actually entrenching poverty in Britain — isolating and trapping many of our families and communities. I remember campaigning in London as far back as the 1980s in bleak, high-rise buildings, where some voters lived behind padlocked and chained-up doors. In 2016, for too many places, not enough has changed.\n\nOf course, within these so-called sink estates, behind front doors, families build warm and welcoming homes. But step outside in the worst estates and you’re confronted by concrete slabs dropped from on high, brutal high-rise towers and dark alleyways that are a gift to criminals and drug dealers. The police often talk about the importance of designing out crime, but these estates designed it in. Decades of neglect have led to gangs, ghettos and antisocial behaviour. And poverty has become entrenched, because those who could afford to move have understandably done so.\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of these estates is just how cut off, self-governing and divorced from the mainstream these communities can become. In some places, there is severe social segregation and it damages us all when communities simply don’t come into contact with one another. And that allows social problems to fester and grow unseen. The riots of 2011 didn’t emerge from within terraced streets or low-rise apartment buildings. As spatial analysis of the riots has shown, the rioters came overwhelmingly from these postwar estates. Almost three-quarters of those convicted lived within them. That’s not a coincidence.\n\nAs we tackle this problem, we should learn the lessons from the failed attempts to regenerate estates in the past. A raft of pointless planning rules, local politics and tenants’ concerns about whether regeneration would be done fairly all prevented progress. And if we’re honest, there often just wasn’t the political will and momentum in government to cut through all of this to get things done.\n\nSo what’s our plan? Today I am announcing that we will work with 100 housing estates in Britain, aiming to transform them. A new advisory panel will help to galvanise our efforts and its first job will be to build a list of postwar estates across the country that are ripe for redevelopment, and work with up to 100,000 residents to put together regeneration plans.\n\nFor some, this will simply mean knocking them down and starting again. For others, it might mean changes to layout, upgrading facilities and improving local road and transport links. The panel will also establish a set of binding guarantees for tenants and homeowners so that they are protected.\n\nTo finance this, we’ll establish a new £140m fund that will pump-prime the planning process, temporary rehousing and early construction costs. And we’ll publish an estates regeneration strategy that will sweep away the planning blockages and take new steps to reduce political and reputational risk for projects’ key decision makers and investors.\n\nThere’s a second critical by-product of our plan. Tomorrow a report from Savills will show that this kind of programme could help to catalyse the building of hundreds of thousands of new homes in London alone. This is because existing estates were built at a lower density than many modern developments — poorly laid-out, with wasted open space that was neither park nor garden. So regeneration will work best in areas where land values are high, because new private homes, built attractively and at a higher density, will fund the regeneration of the rest of the estate.\n\nFor decades, sink estates — and frankly, sometimes, the people who lived in them — had been seen as something simply to be managed. It’s time to be more ambitious on every level. The mission here is nothing short of social turnaround, and with massive estate regeneration, tenants protected and land unlocked for new housing all over Britain, I believe that together we can tear down anything that stands in our way.","2016-01-10 08:12:18+00","653092548048400_1108831449141172",8],[8852,"It’s a New Year, and Britain begins it with renewed strength. With a lower deficit and enterprise flourishing, our economy is becoming more secure by the day. With our commitment to increase defence spending and invest in new jets, frigates and armoured vehicles, our brilliant Armed Forces are keeping our nation safe. And having spent the last five years bringing excellence to our schools and reforming welfare, we are extending new opportunities across our country.\n\nFor me, there are no New Year’s resolutions, just the resolve to continue delivering what we promised in our manifesto. The prospects are good. We go into this year with low inflation, rising employment and growth. The question is: what do we do with that? Our answer is: we make Britain greater by giving its people even greater security. So this April, the tax cuts we pledged will start to come into effect and the elderly will get the biggest increase in the state pension for over a decade. We’ll take steps towards three million apprenticeships, 500 new Free Schools, more free childcare, and record levels of funding for the NHS. And we’ll stand ready to prevent and respond to any threat that comes our way. As I saw for myself this week, the weather can have a devastating impact on homes, livelihoods and whole communities. Because of our competent management of the economy, we are not only able to fund the necessary flood defences, emergency services and support; we can actually be flexible about what we spend and where we spend it. So when we face unprecedented and unexpected flooding we are able to give help to families when they need it.\n\nWe also promised something else in our manifesto: giving the British people a say on our relationship with Europe. We’re fighting hard to fix the aspects of our EU membership that cause so much frustration in Britain – so we get a better deal for our country and secure our future. It is a difficult negotiation with 27 other countries. But throughout we are driven by one consideration: what is best for Britain’s economic and national security. In the end, you will decide whether we are stronger and better off with our European neighbours as part of the European Union, or on our own.\n\nBut as we deliver our manifesto, I want to go further, opening up new areas of social reform. I genuinely believe we are in the middle of one of the great reforming decades in our history – what I would call a “turnaround decade”, where we can use the platform of our renewed economic strength to go for real social renewal. So here are the things I want to get done.\n\nOne: home ownership. It is not just an economic outrage, but a moral one that hardworking young people are priced out of the housing market. With Right to Buy and Help to Buy, we have helped people onto the housing ladder. In the next five years, Britain needs to get building. We doubled the annual housing budget in the Spending Review; we will build 200,000 Starter Homes; and if local councils can’t get their act together and build the homes their areas need, we will intervene directly.\n\nTwo: poverty. We have taken great leaps in recent decades, but stubborn and persistent poverty still exists. So we need a more targeted strategy for those most in need of help, focusing on tackling the root causes like worklessness and family instability. And as we develop our Life Chances Strategy this spring, I want us to move further on addiction and mental health, especially in prison, and to rescue more children from being stuck in failing care systems. That’s why, in the next five years, our reforms to social services will be as radical as the reforms to our schools.\n\nThree: social mobility. We live in a country where too many people are stopped from reaching their potential because of their background. Of course, education and training are crucial here. But discrimination, sadly, still exists in our country. So we’ll step up our effort to complete the fight for equality with, for example, more work to close the gender pay gap, with a new strategy set out in the New Year.\n\nFour: extremism. This is one of the biggest issues facing our country. Of course, we need to tackle the hate preachers and take down the online material that radicalises so many. But we also need to address the issues that for too long have been swept under the carpet. Failure to integrate, the dangers of segregation and deprivation, women treated as second-class citizens, communities living side by side but never coming into contact with each other – these will all be issues that Louise Casey will address in her review for the Government later this year, and we will respond with vigour.\n\nIf we really get to grips with these problems this year, we won’t just be a richer nation, but a stronger, more unified, more secure one. It won’t be easy. These problems have been generations in the making. And many of them are tangled together. Just consider this. Right now, there are more young black men in prison than studying at our top universities. That scandal brings together so many of these problems I have spoken about: poor life chances that, though they never excuse a life of crime, often find people heading down that track; poor schooling, because that holds people back; discrimination, because there is even evidence to suggest that men from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to get a custodial sentence than white men; and extremism, which sometimes is even incubated in state institutions, such as prisons.\n\nFacts like this show that our social problems aren’t just ingrained; they’re enmeshed with one another. So yes, we’re going to spend this year delivering the education, training, jobs, tax cuts, healthcare and housing people need. But we’re also going to make sure no-one should be on the outside looking in at all these things – that everyone is a part of Britain’s rise. In doing so, we can make 2016 a game changer for our country.\n\nThere are many people who will tell you how deeply they care about these issues. They will shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions. But we’re the ones who are able to make the arguments and take the difficult decisions in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security. So while others are on protest march, we remain on the long walk to a Greater Britain. We won’t get there overnight. But during 2016, we will make some of our most significant strides yet.","2016-01-01 17:03:45+00","653092548048400_1104215029602814",8],[8854,"Happy New Year!","2016-01-01 00:00:59+00","653092548048400_1103789459645371",8],[8856,"I've just chaired a COBRA meeting on the unprecedented flooding.

Christians from Africa to Asia will go to church on Christmas morning full of joy, but many in fear of persecution. Throughout the United Kingdom, some will spend the festive period ill, homeless or alone.\n\nWe must pay tribute to the thousands of doctors, nurses, carers and volunteers who give up their Christmas to help the vulnerable – and to those who are spending this season even further from home. Right now, our brave Armed Forces are doing their duty, around the world: in the skies of Iraq and Syria, targeting the terrorists that threaten those countries and our security at home; on the seas of the Mediterranean, saving those who attempt the perilous crossing to Europe; and on the ground, helping to bring stability to countries from Afghanistan to South Sudan.\n\nIt is because they face danger that we have peace. And that is what we mark today as we celebrate the birth of God’s only son, Jesus Christ – the Prince of Peace. As a Christian country, we must remember what his birth represents: peace, mercy, goodwill and, above all, hope. I believe that we should also reflect on the fact that it is because of these important religious roots and Christian values that Britain has been such a successful home to people of all faiths and none.\n\nSo, as we come together with our loved ones, in safety and security, let’s think of those who cannot do the same.

The talks at the COP21 conference in Paris have culminated in a global deal, with every country in the world now signed up to play its part in halting climate change. In other words, this generation has taken vital steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren will see that we did our duty in securing the future of our planet.\n\nIn my speech on the opening day of the conference, I set out the things I believed were needed to make this a good deal. I said it would have to ensure the world’s temperature would not rise more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In fact, the deal pledges to keep global warming “well below” that figure – just as Britain had been calling for. I said it would have to be legally binding – and it will be. I said it would have to come with regular reviews; help for the poorest in the world; and a transfer of technology from the richest to the poorest nations. It does all those things.\n\nWhat is so special about this deal is that it puts the onus on every country to play its part. Britain has already been leading the way in that. For example, last year, in anticipation of the Paris talks, we led on securing the historic agreement with the rest of the European Union to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. We’re also the first country in the world to run a Green Investment Bank, dedicated to greening the economy. A few weeks ago, we even committed to ending unabated coal-fired power in this country.\n\nBut there is only so far we can go by getting our own emissions down. It is developing countries’ action that makes the real difference. But the problem is these are also the nations that can’t afford to invest in new technologies. Here in Britain we’ve taken some significant steps to help them.\n\nAt the UN in September, I increased by a half Britain’s funding for tackling global climate change. We will help poorer nations invest in things like solar energy and flood-resistant crops, which are vital to halting climate change, as well as helping them to adapt to the impact of climate change.\n\nAt the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting last month, I announced a package to support small island countries. We will help these countries to cut the cost of insuring themselves against the impact of climate-related natural catastrophes, and use their maritime resources to stimulate growth in a sustainable way. This is only possible because we have kept our promise to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid.\n\nOver the last couple of months I have hosted state visits from China’s President Xi Jinping and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi – countries which will be vital to driving down global warming, a subject which featured heavily in both visits.\n\nA month ago tomorrow, Paris was the victim of the deadliest terror attack in Europe for more than a decade. Today, it has played host to one of the most positive global steps in history. In striking this deal, the nations of the world have shown what unity, ambition and perseverance can do.

My Commons statement:\n\nMr Speaker, I said I would respond personally to the Foreign Affairs Committee report on extending British military operations to Syria. I have done so today, and copies of my response have been made available to every Member of the House.\n\nThe Committee produced a comprehensive report that asked a series of important questions. I have tried to listen very carefully to the questions and views expressed by Members on both sides of the House, and I want to answer all the relevant questions today. There are different ways of putting them, but they boil down to this: why? Why us? Why now? Is what we are contemplating legal? Where are the ground troops to help us achieve our objectives? What is the strategy that brings together everything we are doing, particularly in Syria? Is there an end to this conflict, and is there a plan for what follows?\n\nLet me deal with each of those questions as directly as I can. First, why? The reason for acting is the very direct threat that ISIL poses to our country and to our way of life. ISIL has attacked Ankara, Beirut and, of course, Paris, as well as likely blowing up a Russian plane with 224 people on board. It has already taken the lives of British hostages, and inspired the worst terrorist attack against British people since 7/7, on the beaches of Tunisia—and, crucially, it has repeatedly tried to attack us right here in Britain. In the last 12 months, our police and security services have disrupted no fewer than seven terrorist plots to attack the UK, every one of which was either linked to ISIL or inspired by its propaganda, so I am in no doubt that it is in our national interest for action to be taken to stop it—and stopping it means taking action in Syria, because Raqqa is its headquarters.\n\nBut why us? My first responsibility as Prime Minister—and our first job in this House—is to keep the British people safe. We have the assets to do that and we can significantly extend the capabilities of the international coalition forces. That is one reason why members of the international coalition, including President Obama and President Hollande, have made it clear to me that they want Britain to stand with them in joining in air strikes in Syria, as well as Iraq. These are our closest allies, and they want our help.\n\nPartly, this is about our capabilities. As we are showing in Iraq, the RAF can carry out what is called “dynamic targeting”, whereby our pilots can strike the most difficult targets at rapid pace and with extraordinary precision, and provide vital battle-winning close air support to local forces on the ground. We have the Brimstone precision missile system, which enables us to strike accurately, with minimal collateral damage—something that even the Americans do not have. RAPTOR—the reconnaissance airborne pod for our Tornado aircraft—has no rival; it currently gathers 60% of the coalition’s entire tactical reconnaissance in Iraq, and it is also equipped for strikes. In addition, our Reaper drones are providing up to 30% of the intelligence in Syria, but they are not currently able to use their low-collateral, high-precision missile systems. We also have the proven ability to sustain our operations—not just for weeks, but, if necessary, for months into the future.\n\nOf course we have those capabilities, but the most important answer to the question, “Why us?”, is, I believe, even more fundamental: we should not be content with outsourcing our security to our allies. If we believe that action can help protect us, then, with our allies, we should be part of that action, not standing aside from it. From that moral point comes a fundamental question: if we will not act now, when our friend and ally France has been struck in this way, then our allies in the world can be forgiven for asking, “If not now, when?”\n\nThat leads to the next question: why now? The first answer to that is, of course, because of the grave danger that ISIL poses to our security—a danger that has clearly intensified in recent weeks—but there are additional reasons why action now is so important. Just look at what has changed—not just the attack in Paris, but the fact that the world has come together and agreed a UN Security Council resolution. There is a real political process under way. This could lead to a new Government in Syria, with whom we can work to defeat ISIL for good. But as I explained to the House yesterday, we cannot wait for that to be complete before we begin acting to degrade ISIL and reducing its capability to attack us.\n\nLet us be clear about the military objectives that we are pursuing. Yes, we want to defeat the terrorists by dismantling their networks, stopping their funding, targeting their training camps and taking out those plotting terrorist attacks against the UK, but there is a broader objective. For as long as ISIL can pedal the myth of a so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, it will be a rallying call for Islamist extremists all around the world, and that makes us less safe. Just as we have reduced the scale and size of the so-called caliphate in Iraq—increasingly pushing it out of Iraq—so we need to do the same thing in Syria.\n\nIndeed, another reason for action now is that the success in Iraq in squeezing the so-called caliphate is put at risk by our failure to act in Syria. This border is not recognised by ISIL, and we seriously hamper our efforts if we stop acting when we reach the Syrian border, so when we come to the question, “Why now?”, we have to ask ourselves whether the risks of inaction are greater than the risks of taking action. Every day we fail to act is a day when ISIL can grow stronger and more plots can be undertaken. That is why all the advice I have received—the military advice, the diplomatic advice and the security advice—all says, yes, that the risks of inaction are greater.\n\nSome have asked specifically whether taking action could make the UK more of a target for ISIL attacks, so let me tell the House that the judgment of the director general of the Security Service and the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that the UK is already in the top tier of countries that ISIL is targeting, so I am clear that the only way to deal with that reality is to address the threat we face, and to do so now.\n\nLet me turn to the question of legality. It is a long-standing constitutional convention that we do not publish our formal legal advice, but the document I have published today shows in some detail the clear legal basis for military action against ISIL in Syria. It is founded on the right of self-defence as recognised in article 51 of the United Nations charter. The right of self-defence may be exercised individually where it is necessary to the UK’s own defence, and of course collectively in the defence of our friends and allies.\n\nThe main basis of the global coalition’s actions against ISIL in Syria is the collective self-defence of Iraq. Iraq has a legitimate Government—one that we support and help. There is a solid basis of evidence on which to conclude, first, that there is a direct link between the presence and activities of ISIL in Syria and its ongoing attack on Iraq, and secondly, that the Assad regime is unwilling and/or unable to take action necessary to prevent ISIL’s continuing attack on Iraq, or indeed attacks on us. It is also clear that ISIL’s campaign against the UK and our allies has reached the level of an “armed attack”, such that force may lawfully be used in self-defence to prevent further atrocities being committed by ISIL.\n\nThis is further underscored by the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2249. We should be clear about what this resolution means and what it says. The whole world came together, including all five members of the Security Council, to agree this resolution unanimously. The resolution states that ISIL\n\n“constitutes a global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security”.\n\nIt calls for member states to take “all necessary measures” to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by ISIL and, crucially, it says that we should\n\n“eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria”.\n\nTurning to the question of which ground forces will assist us, in Iraq the answer is clear. We have the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish peshmerga. In Syria, the situation is more complex. However, as the report I am publishing today shows, we believe that there are around 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters, principally of the Free Syrian Army, who do not belong to extremist groups, and with whom we can co-ordinate attacks on ISIL.\n\nIn addition, Kurdish armed groups have shown themselves capable of taking territory, holding it and administering it, and, crucially, of relieving the suffering that the civilian population had endured under ISIL control. The Syrian Kurds have successfully defended Kurdish areas in northern Syria and retaken territory around the city of Kobane.\n\nModerate armed Sunni Arabs have proved capable of defending territory north of Aleppo. They stopped ISIL’s attempts to capture the main humanitarian border crossing with Turkey and sweep into Idlib province. In the south, the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army has consolidated its control over significant areas, and has worked to prevent terrorists from operating.\n\nThe people I have talked about are ground troops. They need our help; when they get it, they succeed, so in my view, we should do more to help from the air. Those who ask questions about ground troops are absolutely right to do so. The full answer cannot be achieved until there is a new Syrian Government who represent all the Syrian people—not just Sunni, Shi’a and Alawite, but Christian, Druze and others. It is this new Government who will be the natural partner for our forces in defeating ISIL for good. We cannot defeat ISIL simply from the air, or purely with military action alone. It requires a full political settlement. The question is: can we wait for that settlement before we take action? Again, my answer is no.\n\nOn the question of whether this action is part of an overall strategy, the answer is yes. Our approach has four pillars. First, our counter-extremism strategy means that we have a comprehensive plan to prevent and foil plots at home, and to address the poisonous extremist ideology that is the root cause of the threat we face. The second pillar is our support for the diplomatic and political process. We should be clear about that process. Many people across this House have rightly said how vital it is to have all the key regional players around the table, including Iran and Russia. We are now seeing Iran and Saudi Arabia sitting around the same table as America and Russia, as well as France, Turkey and Britain. All of us are working towards the transition to a new Government in Syria.\n\nThe third pillar is the military action that I am describing to degrade ISIL and reduce the threat it poses; it is working in Iraq, and I believe that it can work in Syria. The fourth pillar is immediate humanitarian support and, even more crucially, longer-term stabilisation. The House has heard many times that Britain has so far given over £1.1 billion—by far the largest commitment of any European country, and second only to the United States of America. That is helping to reduce the need for Syrians to attempt the perilous journey to Europe. The donor conference that I am hosting in February together with Germany, Kuwait, Norway and the UN will help further.\n\nThe House is rightly asking more questions about whether there will be a proper post-conflict reconstruction effort to support a new Syrian Government when they emerge. Britain’s answer to that question is absolutely yes. I can tell the House that Britain would be prepared to contribute at least another £1 billion for that task.\n\nAll these elements—counter-terrorism, political and diplomatic, military and humanitarian—need to happen together to achieve a long-term solution in Syria. We know that peace is a process, not an event. I am clear that it cannot be achieved through a military assault on ISIL alone; it also requires the removal of Assad through a political transition. But I am also clear about the sequencing that needs to take place. This is an ISIL-first strategy.\n\nWhat of the end goal? The initial objective is to damage ISIL and reduce its capacity to do us harm. I believe that that can, in time, lead to its eradication. No one predicted ISIL’s rise, and we should not accept that it is somehow impossible to bring it to an end. It is not what the people of Iraq and Syria want; it does not represent the true religion of Islam; and it is losing ground in Iraq, following losses in Sinjar and Baiji.\n\nWe are not naive about the complexity of the task. It will require patience and persistence, and our work will not be complete until we have reached our true end goal, which is having Governments in both Iraq and Syria who can command the confidence of all their peoples. In Syria, that ultimately means a Government without Assad. As Ban Ki-moon has said:\n\n“Missiles may kill terrorists. But good governance kills terrorism.”\n\nThat applies so clearly to both Iraq and Syria.\n\nAs we discuss all these things, people also want to know that we have learned the lessons of previous conflicts. Whatever anyone thought of the Iraq war, terrible mistakes were made in its aftermath in dismantling the state and the institutions of that country. We must never make those mistakes again. The political process in Syria will, in time, deliver new leadership, and we must support that transition. We are not in the business of dismantling the Syrian state or its institutions.\n\nIn Libya, the state and its institutions had been hollowed out after 40 years of dictatorship. When the dictatorship went, the institutions rapidly collapsed. The big difference between Libya and Syria is that in Syria this time we have firm international commitment from all the backers of a future Syrian Government around the table at the Vienna talks. The commitment is clear: to preserve and develop the state in Syria, and allow a new representative Government to govern for all its people.\n\nI have attempted to answer the main questions: why? Why now? Why us? Is it legal? What are the ground forces? Is there a strategy? What is the end point and plan for reconstruction? I know that this is a highly complex situation, and Members on all sides of the House will have other questions that I look forward to trying to answer this morning.\n\nOne question will be about the confused and confusing situation in Syria with regard to Russia’s intervention. Let me reassure the House that the American-led combined air operations centre has a memorandum of understanding with the Russians. That enables daily contact and pragmatic military planning to ensure the safety of all coalition forces, and that would include our brave RAF pilots. Another question will be about whether we are taking sides in a Sunni versus Shi’a conflict, but that is simply not the case. Yes, ISIL is a predominantly Sunni organisation, but it is killing Sunni and Shi’a alike. Our vision for the future of Syria, as with Iraq, is not a sectarian entity, but one that is governed in the interests of all its people. We therefore wholeheartedly welcome the presence of states with both Sunni and Shi’a majorities at the Vienna talks, and their support for international action both against ISIL and towards a diplomatic solution in Syria.\n\nThe House will also want to know what we are doing about the financing of ISIL.\n\nThe document sets that out; it includes intercepting smugglers, sealing borders, and enforcing sanctions to stop people trading with ISIL. Ultimately, ISIL is able to generate income through its control of territory, so although we are working with international partners to squeeze the finances wherever we can, it is the rolling back of ISIL’s territory that will ultimately cut off its finances.\n\nTwo of the most complex questions in an undoubtedly complex situation are these.\n\nFirst, will acting against ISIL in Syria help to bring about transition? I believe the answer is yes, not least because there cannot be genuine transition without maintaining the territorial integrity of Syria. With its current actions, ISIL completely denies that integrity. Crucially, destroying ISIL helps the moderate forces, and those moderate forces will be crucial to Syria’s future. Secondly, does our view that Assad must go help in the fight against ISIL, or—as some claim—does that confuse the picture? The expert advice that I have could not be clearer: we will not beat ISIL if we waiver in our view that ultimately Assad must go. We cannot win over majority Sunni opinion, which is vital for the long-term stability of Syria, if we suddenly to change our position.\n\nIn the end it comes back to one main question: should we take action? All those who say that ultimately we need a diplomatic solution and a transition to a new Government in Syria are right. Working with a new representative Government is the way to eradicate ISIL in Syria in the long term, but can we wait for that to happen before we take military action? I say we cannot.\n\nLet me be clear: there will not be a vote in this House unless there is a clear majority for action, because we will not hand a publicity coup to ISIL.\n\nI am also clear that any motion we bring before this House will explicitly recognise that military action is not the whole answer. Proud as I am of our incredible servicemen and women, I will not pretend or overstate the significance of our potential contribution. I will not understate the complexity of this issue, nor the risks that are inevitably involved in any military action, but we do face a fundamental threat to our security. We cannot wait for a political transition. We have to hit these terrorists in their heartlands right now: and we must not shirk our responsibility for security, or hand it to others.\n\nThroughout our history, the United Kingdom has stood up to defend our values and our way of life. We can, and we must, do so again. I commend this statement to the House.","2015-11-26 13:25:29+00","653092548048400_1085620321462285",8],[8877,"Everyone who has seen \"Yes, Prime Minister\" knows the central role that Bernard, the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary, plays in the life of a Prime Minister and of Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nThis morning, my Bernard - my Principal Private Secretary - died of cancer.

So I want the British people to know they have a government that understands the importance of our national security and that we will take whatever actions are necessary to keep our country safe.\n\nThis is not a time to equivocate about allowing our police to shoot a terrorist to save the lives of innocent people. It is not a time to stand back and wish for another world where Jihadi John or Reyaad Khan could somehow be arrested, rather than stopped in their tracks. Neither is it a moment to question our support for our dedicated security and intelligence services, who risk their lives day in and day out – often necessarily without any recognition – in order to keep us safe.\n\nSo later in Parliament I am setting out our Strategic Defence and Security Review, a comprehensive plan to back our Armed Forces, counter-terrorism police and intelligence agencies with the resources they need to defeat this terrorism and to tackle the many other threats we face in a world that is ever more dangerous and uncertain.\n\nEconomic security and national security go hand in hand. So at the heart of our strategy is our decision to see through our long-term economic plan and use our renewed economic strength to invest further in our security. As a result, the United Kingdom will be the only major country in the world which is simultaneously going to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of our GDP on defence and the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of our GNI on development, while also increasing investment in our security and intelligence agencies and in counter-terrorism.\n\nWe will use this comprehensive investment to cover the full spectrum of measures needed. This includes a real focus on tackling the causes of the threats we face – not just their consequences. So we will tackle the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism and refocus our aid budget to support fragile and broken states and regions, to prevent conflict and promote the golden thread of conditions that drive prosperity across the world: the rule of law, good governance and the growth of democracy.\n\nOur strategy includes deepening our resources and international co-operation on counter-terrorism to detect and foil plots from wherever they emanate in the world. So along with 1,900 new staff for our agencies and increased investment in counter-terrorism police, we will make a major new investment in a new generation of surveillance drones.\n\nThese British-designed unmanned aircraft will fly at the very edge of the earth’s atmosphere and allow us to observe our adversaries for weeks on end, providing critical intelligence for our forces. As part of our historic partnership, under the Lancaster House Treaty, we also intend to make a significant joint investment with France in developing unmanned combat air vehicles.\n\nThe bottom line of our National Security Strategy must always be the willingness and capability to use force where necessary. On Friday evening the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed Resolution 2249, calling on member states to take “all necessary measures” against Isil in both Syria and Iraq, and the “global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security” Isil represents.\n\nIn the coming days, I will respond personally to the foreign affairs select committee, making the case for Britain to join our international allies in going after Isil at their headquarters in Syria, not just Iraq. We cannot leave the burden and risks of protecting our country to others. Such action would be one key element of a comprehensive, long-term strategy to defeat Isil, in parallel with a major international effort to bring an end to the war in Syria.\n\nFor this and for any other tasks that may arise in future, this Government will ensure that our Armed Forces always have the capabilities they need. Over the last five years we have reconfigured Britain’s Armed Forces so they are able to deal with modern and evolving threats. Over the next decade we will invest more than £178 billion in buying and maintaining equipment – including doubling our investment in equipment to support our Special Forces. We will create two new strike brigades, forces of up to 5,000 personnel each, fully equipped to deploy rapidly and sustain themselves in the field.\n\nWe will establish two additional Typhoon squadrons and an additional squadron of F35 Lightning combat aircraft to operate from our new aircraft carriers. And we will invest in nine maritime patrol aircraft to protect our nuclear deterrent, hunt down hostile submarines and enhance our maritime search and rescue. Not one of these capabilities is an optional extra or an act of vanity. These investments are an act of clear-eyed self-interest to ensure our prosperity and security.\n\nBritain is fortunate to have some of the finest Armed Forces, counter-terrorism police and security services in the world. This Government will ensure they stay that way. Using our renewed economic strength, we will equip them to defeat the terrorist threat and help keep us safe for generations to come.","2015-11-23 08:11:03+00","653092548048400_1084042901620027",8],[8881,"The UN resolution on ISIL is an important moment.

Such racism in 21st-century Britain, I said, was a disgrace, and I committed our party to ending discrimination and finishing the fight for real equality. The audience rose to their feet. It was a significant moment. And it provoked three reactions.\n\nThe first was: “What on earth are the Tories doing speaking about equality? It’s not their issue.” To this I say “nonsense”. We’re not just the party of the first Jewish prime minister and the first female prime minister; we’re the party that introduced the Disability Discrimination Act, legalised gay marriage and reduced stop-and-search, and that today will start forcing companies to publish the gap between men and women’s pay, and making police record Islamophobia as a separate hate crime.\n\nI accept that we haven’t always got this 100% right. No party ever has. And, because of our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome, for too long we have thought the only barrier to success was a lack of a decent education. Of course, that’s the most important thing – and it’s why school reform has been at the heart of our plan in government.\n\nBut we need to sweep away the other things holding people back, not least discrimination. You can give someone all the opportunities in the world – a brilliant school, first-class training, decent jobs – but it’s no good if they’re prevented from getting on because of their gender, race, religion, sexuality or disability. Getting this right is a natural and logical next step for a modern, compassionate Conservative party that wants to extend social mobility.\n\nThe second reaction was: “All right then, the Tories get this, but the only thing you can do is pass laws, and where are your proposals?” Of course, laws are important, like ours on disability discrimination and equal marriage. And we should recognise that the Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1976, or the Equal Pay Act from 1970 didn’t just outlaw discrimination, they also helped to change attitudes and shift public opinion.\n\nBut for all the legislation we have passed, discrimination still persists. It’s no longer signs on doors that say “no blacks allowed”; it’s quieter and more subtle discrimination. It’s the disappointment of not getting your first choice of university place; it’s being passed over for promotion and not knowing why; it’s organisations that recruit in their own image and aren’t confident enough to do something different, like employing a disabled person or a young black man or woman. In my opinion, you won’t change these attitudes simply through more laws, but in smarter, more innovative ways.\n\nThe third reaction was: “Right, if you mean this, when and how will you show us how?” We have managed to get some of the biggest graduate employers to pledge to anonymise their job applications – in other words, make them name-blind. That means those assessing applications will not be able to see the person’s name, so the ethnic or religious background it might imply cannot influence their prospects.\n\nThe civil service, BBC, NHS, local government, HSBC, Deloitte, KPMG, Virgin Money, learndirect – all these and more will now recruit people solely on merit. The Conservative party HQ will do it too. Taken together, these organisations employ 1.8 million people.\n\nAnd we’ll go further. Some research has shown that top universities make offers to 55% of white applicants, but only to 23% of black ones. The reasons are complex, but unconscious bias is clearly a risk.

I have always said that we would do whatever was necessary, whatever it took, to track down Emwazi and stop him taking the lives of others.\n\nWe have been working, with the United States, literally around the clock to track him down. This was a combined effort. And the contribution of both our countries was essential.\n\nEmwazi is a barbaric murderer.

And one of the biggest social problems we face is extremism.\n\nSubversive, well-organised and sophisticated in their methods, Islamist extremists don’t just threaten our security, they jeopardise all that we’ve built together – our successful multi-racial, multi-faith democracy. So we have to confront them wherever we find them.\n\nThat’s why, today, we publish our Counter-Extremism Strategy. It sets out our plan to tackle this poison on every level: to counter the ideology that underpins it; to take on both the violent and non-violent parts of the creed; to empower the mainstream voices that are too often drowned out; and to tackle the alienation and segregation that can allow extremist narratives to take root.\n\nAs we do all this, we should remember these vital insights. One: this is a generational battle; perhaps the defining one of this century. Defeating our enemies will take time, patience and require us constantly to adapt.\n\nTwo: this is, at its heart, a battle of ideas. On one side sit the extremists, with a deliberate strategy to infect public debate, divide our communities and advance their warped worldview.\nOn the other side must sit everyone else – not just the institutions of the state, such as the government, police and security services; but community groups and the rest of society. The extremist narrative needs to be fought every day at the kitchen table, on the university campus, online and on the airwaves. \n\nIn the end, this battle will only be won through argument and persuasion – people taking a stand to demonstrate the incredible power of our liberal, democratic values, and the emptiness of theirs.\n\nFor those who have been sucked furthest into the extremist worldview, our strategy also includes new proposals for intensive – and mandatory – de-radicalisation programmes. That means attendance at programmes can be made a condition of a licence for terrorist offenders after their release from prison, or part of a court order against a suspected terrorist – including those returning from Syria.\n\nThree: while Islamist extremists in no way represent the true spirit of Islam, we cannot ignore the fact that they attempt to justify their views and actions through Islamic scripture and theology. \n\nGlobally, it is a challenge for all of Islam that a perverted, illiberal and hostile interpretation of this great religion has been allowed to grow. It is a problem that so many see the West as an oppressor, and buy into the grievances, if not necessarily the violence. And it is a worry for the world that some feel allegiance only to a religious brotherhood, instead of to their fellow citizens in nation states.\n\nSo in response, we need to support Muslims who are confronting the extremist narrative and providing a positive alternative. There are already so many. Last week I convened the first meeting of my Community Engagement Forum – many of them Muslims angry at the hijacking of their faith, eager to take a stand.\n\nI know we have got to back these people wholeheartedly. So we will offer all the protection, funding, practical help and support we possibly can. That’s why, as part of our strategy, we will provide a further £5 million this year to community groups so they reach even more young people.\n\nBut we need more – far more – people to come forward. As a government, I know we must own this problem. But our Muslim communities must own it, too. We have all got a critical part to play, but I strongly feel the currently silent majority can make all the difference.\n\nThey’re central to standing up and challenging the warped interpretation of theology and scripture. They’re central to putting forward a liberal, tolerant and inclusive Islam, and demonstrating how it can work in harmony with democracy, freedom and equality.\n\nThey can show the boy in East London or the girl in Birmingham how proud you can feel to be both British and Muslim, without conflict or contradiction. And in standing up, by speaking out, I am confident that we will defeat the extremists, and together build the Greater Britain that is within our grasp.","2015-10-19 07:05:34+00","653092548048400_1067675516590099",8],[8911,"Today's employment rate is the highest since records began.

For those of us committed to that goal, there has been a recent slew of good news. Two months ago, we returned to a House of Commons in which the number of women MPs had risen by a third, and one third of those around the cabinet table are women. Last week the army appointed the highest-ranking woman in its history, Major General Susan Ridge. And this week we reveal that women now make up at least 25 per cent of all FTSE 100 company boards — a target set by government, a target met.\n\nThat’s a cause for celebration. But the job is not complete. The Commons is nearly a third female; it should be half. The armed forces need more women in all ranks. Boardrooms need more female members. As a result of our jobs revolution there are more women in work than ever before, but one problem persists: the difference between men and women’s pay.\n\nUnder the coalition government, the gender pay gap narrowed. For full-time workers under 40, it is almost zero. But overall, a woman still earns just 80p for every £1 earned by a man. That is a scandal — and I’m determined to close the gap. For me, this comes back to the type of government I want to run: a One Nation government, which brings our country together and helps everyone, whoever they are, get on in life. So here’s my plan.\n\nOne: transparency. We have already introduced equal pay audits for those companies that have lost employment tribunals. But today I’m announcing a really big move: we will make every single company with 250 employees or more publish the gap between average female earnings and average male earnings. That will cast sunlight on the discrepancies and create the pressure we need for change, driving women’s wages up.\n\nThis goes back to what we announced in the budget last week. Our aim is to fundamentally rebalance our economy — to transform Britain from a high-welfare, high-tax, low-pay economy into a lower-welfare, lower-tax, higher-pay society. Higher pay is something we want for everyone. That is why the chancellor announced the national living wage, which starts next April at £7.20 and will reach over £9 by 2020. This will primarily help women, who tend to be in lower-paid jobs. It will help close the gender pay gap. But we need to go further, and that’s why introducing gender pay audits is so important. It’s part of a new British contract: we give businesses the lowest corporation tax in the G20, increase their national insurance allowance and cut their regulations; in return, they pay their staff properly, and fairly.\n\nTwo: we must widen girls’ horizons. It’s great that, for instance, nearly half of our medics, biological scientists and chemists are women. But just 7 per cent of engineers are female. Women are just a fifth of IT technicians. There’s only one female Supreme Court judge. We need to show schoolgirls that there are no no-go professions. That’s why our new careers service puts businesses at the helm and why we are campaigning to drive up the number of girls doing science, tech, engineering and manufacturing. It’s working: since 2010, girls doing maths A level is up by 8 per cent and those doing physics is up by 15 per cent.\n\nThree: we must help more women to reach the top. While they are 47 per cent of the workforce, women are just 34 per cent of managers, directors and senior officials. Today I’m speaking at the Times CEO summit. Those bosses have shown that, without legislation and without arbitrary quotas, you can bring about change. In just five years, women on FTSE 100 boards have increased from 12.5 per cent to a quarter. I’ll be congratulating those CEOs and asking them to keep up the momentum.\n\nFour: we need to address childcare. The pay gap flows from the fact that, when women have children, many cannot afford to go back to work full time — or even at all. That then prevents them from moving up through the ranks. That’s why affordable childcare is the centrepiece of this One Nation government. One of the first things we’ve done is legislate for 30 hours of free childcare for all three and four- year-olds, doubling the existing allowance. And we are making childcare tax-free, too, worth up to £2,000 per year for every child.\n\nTransparency, skills, representation, affordable childcare — these things can end the gender pay gap in a generation. That’s my goal. In past centuries, the Brontë sisters published their novels under men’s names; Marie Curie released her research as her husband; Ada Lovelace made great leaps as the first computer programmer but watched her male colleague get the credit. Then came the First World War. Women more than proved their mettle in the world of work. The vote came in 1918. Nancy Astor was the first female MP to take her seat. The first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, transformed the country. That happened in just a few decades. So just think what we can do over the next generation.\n\nWhen my daughters, Nancy and Florence, start work, I want them to look back at the gender pay gap in the same way we look back at women not voting and not working — as something outdated and wrong that we overcame, together.","2015-07-14 07:11:34+00","653092548048400_1019065314784453",8],[8960,"Our charities undertake vital work, bringing communities together and providing support to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\nBut the conduct of some fundraisers used by them is frankly unacceptable and damages the reputation of the sector as a whole, which is why we’re introducing a new law to make sure charities raise funds in the right sort of way.","2015-07-11 10:25:19+00","653092548048400_1017744394916545",8],[8962,"The introduction of a National Living Wage is an important step as we move to a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare society. #SummerBudget","2015-07-08 18:39:19+00","653092548048400_1016563601701291",8],[8966,"At 11.30am today, the country comes together to remember the victims of one of the deadliest terrorist atrocities on mainland Britain.\n \nTen years on from the 7/7 London attacks, the threat from terrorism continues to be as real as it is deadly – the murder of 30 innocent Britons whilst holidaying in Tunisia is a brutal reminder of that fact.

Having your own place is an important stake in our economy. It’s also one of the best expressions of the aspirational country we want to build, where hard work is rewarded.\n\nIt’s also about social justice. We don’t want this to be a country where if you’re rich you can buy a home, but if you’re less well off you can’t. We want it to be One Nation, where whoever you are, you can get on in life.\n\nIn the past five years, we got builders building, lenders lending, and government-backed schemes alone helped more than 200,000 people on to the property ladder.\n\nThe next five will be about going much further. We will help people to reach their dreams by keeping Help to Buy until 2020 and extending the Right to Buy to 1.3 million housing association tenants. They will get a discount of up to 70 per cent to buy their own home, and we will open a register of interest so that thousands can sign up in the first year.\n\nAnd once you’ve got your home, you’ll be able to pass it on. As we promised in our manifesto, we’ll take the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the richest — and it’s a promise we will keep. As we said we would, we’ll pay for this reform by limiting the pension tax relief to those who are earning more than £150,000. It can only be right that when you’ve worked hard to own your own home, it will go to your family and not the taxman.\n\nWe will also boost supply. We will build 200,000 starter homes by 2020, sold at below market rate and for first-time buyers under the age of 40. To deliver on this commitment, we will ensure every reasonably sized housing site includes a proportion of these homes for young people.\n\nWe will also say to local councils: you must give land with planning permission to people who want to build or commission their own homes. Custom-built homes account for 60 per cent of all of Germany’s new housing stock, and our plans will double the number in our country. We will also undertake a massive programme of regeneration around our train stations, as part of a wider drive to release public sector land for 150,000 homes.\n\nWe will also make the planning system more effective. We will set out more detail next week, as part of our productivity plan. It is unacceptable, for example, that many councils are still not close to having a plan for delivering the homes their communities need. We will take action, in consultation with local communities, to deliver the plans for those areas which have failed to do so.\n\nOf course, there will be opponents of much of the above. We are determined to take them on.\n\nFirst, the opponents of Right to Buy. There are those who think it’s unfair on private renters, who don’t get these discounts. But we’re offering them help through schemes such as shared ownership and Help to Buy. Let’s now help others, some of whom are the least well-off in our country. We’re proud that it’s the Conservatives who are giving them some hope, and if anyone wants to argue with us on that, we say bring it on.\n\nThen there are those who oppose Right to Buy because they think it won’t work, and will reduce housing stock. But the system right now doesn’t work. One of the main ways to encourage housing associations to build more homes is to increase their revenue. That means increasing social rents. And that means increasing housing benefit — which comes from either taxing or borrowing more. This is another of the Labour-inspired merry-go-rounds we need to get off. Housing benefit already costs us £24 billion a year, two thirds of what we spend on defence. That figure needs to come down. And despite housing benefit revenue doubling in the past 13 years, some housing associations aren’t building enough homes — indeed, some aren’t building at all.\n\nWe have a better model. By helping people to own their own home, through Right to Buy, we can turn tenants into homeowners and reduce housing benefit bills. And by selling off the most expensive council houses when they become vacant we can replace every home we sell — whether an expensive council house or one through Right to Buy. And we will do so quicker than the current three-year rule requires.\n\nSo we will transform Britain: from a lower-home-ownership, higher-tax, higher-housing-benefit country to one that encourages home ownership, reduces taxes, lowers housing benefit bills and builds more homes.\n\nSecond, there will be the opponents of planning reform. We will always protect the green belt and make sure planning decisions are made by local people.\n\nBut the fact is that just 10 per cent of England is developed. There is capacity for 400,000 homes on brownfield land — we need to get building. And as we do, we will make sure the homes look good. We have already given local people the power to create neighbourhood plans; more than 1,000 are well under way. This gives local people an even greater ability to decide where new homes go and what they look like. And we will go further in the coming months.\n\nBut that all requires planning reform. It’s simple: you are either pro-reform, or not; for building homes, or not; on the side of young people, or not. We know our position. As a One Nation government, we will always be squarely on the side of those who want to get on.","2015-07-04 09:38:20+00","653092548048400_1014450811912570",8],[8970,"The world has lost a great man.

As the names and identities of the victims in Tunisia emerge – and the horror of what they faced becomes clear – those feelings grow. Everyone is asking the same thing: how can a day at the beach for families and friends have turned into a scene of such horror?\n\nThe man who did this, the smiling gunman with a Kalashnikov hidden in a parasol, demonstrates the level of evil we are dealing with. It’s an evil we’ve seen on Mount Sinjar in Iraq and in shopping malls in Kenya; at magazine offices in Paris and in schools in Pakistan.\n\nOn the same day as the holidaymakers in Tunisia came under attack, workers near Lyon and worshippers in Kuwait fell victim to this evil, as did over 100 Syrians, who were executed in their homes in Kobane by ISIL.\n\nBut we will not be cowed. To our shock and grief we must add another word: resolve. Unshakeable resolve. We will stand up for our way of life. So ours must be a full-spectrum response – a response at home and abroad; in the immediate aftermath and far into the future.\n\nThe first thing we must do is everything we can to help the victims of this attack. Our consular crisis centre has been running 24/7. We now have a team of over 50 consular staff, police officers and experts from the Red Cross on the ground in Sousse.\n\nHundreds of police officers are now working on this operation both in Tunisia and here at home – providing vital support to families; helping the Tunisians to identify those that were murdered; and launching an investigation into what happened.\n\nWe are doing everything necessary to get people home and to help the injured, including sending a team of military medical liaison officers out to Sousse to assist with medevac as required.\n\nAnd in the coming days we will do all we can to bring home those who lost their lives as quickly as possible. I have been speaking to President Essebsi to thank the Tunisian authorities for their assistance, and we’ve been discussing what more we can do.\n\nAcross the world, we must do more to work together and build our capacity to deal with terrorism. ISIL may use ancient barbarism in its methods of killing, but it is modern in its propaganda techniques, using social media as its primary weapon.\n\nThat is why we must give our police and security services the tools they need to root out this poison. And we must look at how we can work with countries like Tunisia to counter this online propaganda.\n\nWe must also deal with it at its source, in places like Syria, Iraq and Libya, from where ISIL is peddling and plotting its death cult. That means supporting governments to strengthen weak political institutions and tackle political instability. \n\nThese ungoverned spaces are the areas in which the terrorist groups thrive. British aircraft are already delivering the second largest number of airstrikes over Iraq, where ISIL has taken hold.\n\nOur airborne intelligence and surveillance assets are assisting other countries with their operations over Syria. And we are working with the UN, our EU and US partners to support the formation of a Government of National Accord in Libya. And we will continue to work with our partners in the region.\n\nThe third thing, perhaps the most important thing, is confronting the poisonous ideology that is driving terrible actions like those we saw on Friday.\n\nThat ideology stems from an extremist narrative, which hijacks the religion of Islam. It says that the West is bad and freedom is wrong. It says that women are inferior and homosexuality is evil. It tells people that religious rule trumps the rule of law, that Caliphate trumps nation state.\n\nTo defeat this poisonous ideology, we must be clear about why it is so wrong. We must expose and defeat what it is that persuades young people, from Tunisia to Kuwait, from Belgium to Britain, to join ISIL.\n\nWhen the gunman attacked innocent people spending time with their families on the beach, he was attacking the very things we stand for.\n\nWe must be stronger at standing up for our values – of peace, democracy, tolerance, freedom. We must be more intolerant of intolerance – rejecting anyone whose views condone the Islamist extremist narrative and create the conditions for it to flourish.\nWe must strengthen our institutions that put our values into practice: our democracy, our rule of law, the rights of minorities, our free media, our law enforcements – all the things the terrorists hate.\n\nTo carry out an attack in the month when millions of Muslims are observing the holy month of Ramadan and to do so in the name of that faith is an insult to all Muslims worldwide.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with all communities who are affected and outraged by these events, and remain united in our determination not to let them divide us.\n\nAfter all, this is not the war between Islam and the West that ISIL want people believe. It’s between the extremists who want hatred to flourish and the rest of the world who want freedom to prosper. They will kill anyone that doesn’t adhere to their warped worldview – Muslim and non-Muslim. They demonstrate that day in, day out.\n\nWe have something the terrorists don’t. We have the great British spirit that triumphs in the face of adversity.\n\nIt’s the spirit we have always shown when we faced threats to our nation in our history. It's the spirit that saw London rebound after the 7/7 attacks, whose 10th anniversary we mark next month. It’s the spirit we saw as British tourists went to the beach in Tunisia this weekend, determined not to be cowed by the terrorists.\nWe are the people who stand up to hatred. They are the cowards who murder defenceless people on a beach. They stand for oppression; we stand for freedom, and a peaceful, tolerant way of life.\n\nThe flag flies at half-mast above Downing Street today. That reflects our sympathy with the victims and their families. Our hearts go out to them. But it also represents our resolve to protect our very way of life – and that is exactly what we must act upon.","2015-06-29 07:45:35+00","653092548048400_1011883455502639",8],[8975,"Honoured to join hundreds of people in Guildford to celebrate our brilliant armed forces. #ArmedForcesDay","2015-06-27 11:07:17+00","653092548048400_1010728642284787",8],[8977,"We've made significant progress at this European Council.

It is, of course, typical of her selfless sense of service that she would have us treat this day just like any other.\n\nBut while I rarely advocate disobeying Her Majesty, I do think it is right that today we should stop and take a moment as a nation to mark this historic milestone - and to thank Her Majesty for the extraordinary service she has given to our country over more than six decades. \n\nHer Majesty the Queen inspires us all with her incredible service, her dignified leadership and the extraordinary grace with which she carries out her duties. \n\nOn her 21st birthday, in a radio broadcast from Cape Town, over four years before she would accede to the throne, the then Princess dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth saying: “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.”\n\nIt is one thing for a 21 year old to utter those inspiring words. It is another to live by them for more than 60 years.\n\nIt is truly humbling to comprehend the scale of service that Her Majesty has given to this country.\n\nThe reign of Queen Elizabeth II has been a golden thread running through three post-war generations. And she has presided over more than two-thirds of our history as a full democracy.\n\nWhen I was born, Her Majesty had already been reigning for fourteen years.\n\nIn 63 years and 216 days she has worked with 12 Prime Ministers, 6 Archbishops of Canterbury and 9 Cabinet Secretaries. \n\nShe has answered 3.5 million pieces of correspondence, sent over 100,000 telegrams to Centenarians across the Commonwealth and met more people than any other Monarch in history.\n\nAnd yet, whether it is something we suspect she enjoys, such as the Highland Games, or something we suspect she might be less keen on, such as spending New Year’s Eve in the Millennium Dome, she never, ever falters.\n\nHer selfless sense of service and duty have earned her unparalleled respect and admiration, not only in Britain, but all around the world.\n\nTurning to her leadership, Her Majesty exemplifies the unique combination of tradition and progress that has come to define us as a nation.\n\nShe has been a rock of stability in an era in which our country has changed so much, providing an enduring focal point for all her people.\n\nBut she has also recognised the need to embrace change. \n\nAs she said in an address to both Houses of Parliament back on her Golden Jubilee in 2002: “For if a Jubilee becomes a moment to define an age, then for me we must speak of change...Change has become a constant; managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future.”\n\nHer Majesty’s contribution to shaping the future of the Commonwealth has been particularly extraordinary. Some doubted whether this organisation would succeed. But she has assiduously supported it, growing it from just 7 members in 1952 to 53 today - and building a unique family of nations that spans every continent, all the main religions and nearly a third of the world’s population.\n\nAs a diplomat and an ambassador for Britain, it is hard to overstate what she has done for our country, representing us on 265 official visits to 116 different countries, including 22 visits to Canada alone.\n\nAnd from her post-Apartheid visit to South Africa, to her State visit to Ireland, we have seen time and again how the presence and judicious words of Her Majesty can build partnership and progress like no other. \n\nShe is held in deep affection by leaders around the world. Even ardent republicans fall under her spell.\n\nAs we commemorate this historic milestone, I know that Her Majesty would want us to pay a particular tribute to the service and support of her whole family, not least the Duke of Edinburgh who has stood by her side every day of her reign.\n\nThroughout her long service, the Queen has carried herself with an extraordinary grace and presence.\n\nShe has led a gentle evolution of the monarchy, bringing it closer to the people while maintaining its dignity.  \n\nShe pioneered the first televised Christmas Day Message, she opened up the Royal Collection and Palaces, and she invented the Royal Walkabout, so that she could meet more people on her visits.\n\nPeople who meet the Queen often talk about it for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd I am sure that I speak for all of my eleven predecessors, when I say that that going to see the Queen to form a government, and then meeting her once a week, is one of the most enjoyable, inspiring and humbling honours of this office. \n\nWhen I joined Her Majesty for her State visit to Germany earlier this year, I learnt that there are many female sovereigns that the Germans call “die Königin” - but there is only one they call “die Queen”. \n\nIn fact the German dictionary – the Duden - provides as its example sentence, “The Queen is coming on a State Visit to Berlin” - and then offers one key grammatical prescript: there is no plural.\n\nThe Queen is our Queen. And we could not be more proud of her.\n\nShe has served this country with unerring grace, dignity and decency.\n\nAnd long may she continue to do so.","2015-09-09 11:47:09+00","653092548048400_1048576275166690",8],[8935,"Great to meet the new Year 7 students at Corby Technical College today - an inspirational free school.","2015-09-02 16:53:19+00","653092548048400_1044395355584782",8],[8937,"By returning the Conservatives to government with a majority, the British people gave us a clear instruction: to continue on the path of recovery.\n\nAs politics gets back into full swing this week, I can assure people there will be no let-up in the longterm economic plan that is putting our economy on a stable footing. In fact, the shocks in the global markets this summer underlined just how important that task is.\n\nWhy do people rightly value economic stability? Because that is what makes it possible to deliver the security we all yearn for. At the heart of our election manifesto was that simple goal: to give people security at every stage of their lives.\n\nSecurity is formed of many things: having a decent home; knowing that you can afford childcare; getting the training you need to secure a worthwhile career; earning enough not just to get through the month, but to get on in life. The economic progress we’ve made in recent years has been essential in delivering on this agenda. We’ve taken 3.8 million people out of income tax, trained more than two million apprentices and begun the vital work of building more homes and enabling more people to buy them.\n\nWith our growing economy we can now do more. That’s why we are able to double free childcare for three and four-year-olds, roll out Help to Buy and build 200,000 discounted starter homes. These policies are built on economic success. Without the hard work of recent years we simply wouldn’t be able to afford them.\n\nThe most important source of security is a well-paid job. But those jobs cannot be guaranteed by repairing the economy alone. They take reforms, too — like capping welfare, which we’ve reduced to £20,000 a year; like boosting businesses, whose taxes we’ve cut; like boosting apprenticeships and expanding our universities, which now have no cap on the number of places they can offer. It’s working. We’ve hit record levels of employment. It’s that combination of recovery and reform that will enable us to help those who often have the least security: the lowest paid.\n\nThe national living wage will be introduced in April, giving low-paid workers a £20 a week pay rise. By the end of the decade, it will reach at least £9 an hour. Combine that with an increase in the personal allowance to £12,500 and you can see the power of the modern Conservative party’s One Nation message. We back work. We promote well-paid work. We want you to keep more of your own money. That’s why we can say: we are the true party of working people in Britain today.\n\nBut the national living wage will only work if it is properly enforced. Businesses are responsible for making that happen, and today I’m announcing how we will make sure they do. We’ve already doubled the fines for non-payment of the national minimum wage — and we will double them again for that and the national living wage.\n\nWe will significantly increase the enforcement budget, set up a new team in HMRC to take forward criminal prosecutions for those who deliberately don’t comply and, from this autumn, ensure that anyone found guilty will be considered for disqualification from being a company director for 15 years. All that will be overseen by a new labour market enforcement director. So, to unscrupulous employers who think that they can get labour on the cheap, the message is clear: underpay your staff and you will pay the price.\n\nBy making sure that working people properly benefit from the recovery, we are winning the argument for pro-business, pro-enterprise economics. That argument has to be won by every political generation. Those of us who fought socialism in the 1980s and perhaps thought that the “red in tooth and claw” variety was dead were clearly wrong.\n\nLook at today’s Labour leadership candidates. All of them are in a race to the left, vowing to borrow, tax and spend more — all the things that failed in the last century and were rejected at the last election. Listening to some of the anti-Nato, anti-American, profoundly anti-business and anti-enterprise debates is like Groundhog Day. Labour aren’t learning. They’re slaves to a failed dogma that has always left working people paying the price. One of their most disturbing tendencies is their obedience to left-wing union leaders — the people who are behind the Tube strikes that have wreaked chaos in the capital this summer.\n\nWe are changing the law so that strikes can go ahead for essential services only with a 50 per cent turnout and 40 per cent support. We are condemning walkouts that are not the absolute last resort.\n\nThis contrast between Labour support for disruptive strikes and our action to help people get on drives home the point: which is the true party of working people?\n\nLabour, who support the unions of well-paid Tube drivers and even-better-paid union bosses? Or us, the Conservatives — the ones who are on the side of the student who just wants to get to college, the nurse who just wants to get to work, the shopkeeper who just wants to get some customers through her door?\n\nOur autumn agenda is about keeping our foot to the floor on the recovery. If we do that, we can turn a low-pay, high-tax, high-welfare society into one with higher pay, lower taxes and less reliance on welfare — restoring the link between hard work and reward. That is what will help people across our country. And that is what my One Nation mission is all about.","2015-09-01 07:29:23+00","653092548048400_1043708238986827",8],[8939,"In the last Parliament, we created 2.3 million apprenticeships.

One nation, one United Kingdom. It is that brand of modern, compassionate conservatism that has guided us since May 8 - and it will continue to guide this Government for the rest of this Parliament.\n\nOur central task is to finish turning around our economy. Through our Long Term Economic Plan we are getting the fundamentals right, generating growth, creating jobs, clearing the deficit and offering the British people the security they need to get on in their lives. I am determined that we will build on this foundation. Just as Conservative ideas have won the debate on how to manage the economy, so I believe Conservative ideas can now shape the future in meeting the challenges facing our whole society too.\n\nOn the challenge of delivering an economy that supports working people, it is Conservatives who believe that a free enterprise economy is an ally not an enemy in generating wealth and extending opportunity. By cutting taxes, reforming welfare and increasing minimum wages we are showing we are the real party of working people.\n\nOn tackling poverty, it is Conservative ideas that can make the biggest difference - attacking the causes of poverty, not just the symptoms, by tackling generational unemployment, strengthening families and ensuring that work always pays.\n\nOn delivering security in a dangerous world, we will confront the extremist threat in all its forms and build a stronger, prouder sense of British identity.\n\nAs Conservatives we will also meet our commitments on defence spending and international aid. This is not some naïve neo-conservative internationalism but a hard-headed realism that recognises our prosperity and security are inextricably linked to how we meet the threats of terrorism, poverty and climate change.\n\nOur success also depends on being an outward-facing trading nation and so I will continue leading trade delegations oversees to win new business for Britain.\n\nTaken together all these beliefs add up to a genuine One Nation vision for our country through which I believe Conservative ideas can lead the way for a decade.\n\nYet during the election there were some who suggested we would only be firmly on the side of working people or demonstrate true compassion with the Liberal Democrats holding our hands. These first hundred days have shown this is simply not true. Indeed without the restrictions of coalition we have shown that by being bolder and more radical we can be more progressive and compassionate.\n\nWe are delivering strong, centre-ground, pragmatic and progressive government exemplified by our new National Living Wage and our commitment to a real terms increase of at least £8 billion a year by 2020 to support the NHS’s own Five Year Plan. We are moving from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. By 2020, the new National Living Wage will represent a pay rise of around £100 a week for the lowest paid. While our continued commitment to cutting taxes means we have already raised again the amount you can earn before paying any income tax at all. And the legislation we are bringing forward will mean no increases in income tax, VAT or national insurance in the lifetime of this parliament.\n\nWe are supporting working parents with the challenges of childcare, so they can take on that extra shift or go back to work after a break. So the Queen’s Speech honoured our promise to double free childcare to 30 hours a week for three and four year olds.\n\nWe are also seeing through vital reforms in our public services, including the creation of a truly 7-day NHS. At a time when Labour is giving up on public service reform and appealing to its left-wing base, I believe it is a moment for a Conservative government to be bolder still.\n\nThere is no better example than academy schools. We want everyone to have a chance to succeed and education is the best way of ensuring that. This means schools with strong standards and discipline. It also means giving great headteachers the freedom to run their own schools with the ability to set their own curriculum and pay their staff properly. Academy schools were created to do exactly that. This is something Labour used to understand and we have proudly expanded them, including the creation of entirely new academies as free schools.\n\nI profoundly believe this is the right direction for our country because I want teachers not bureaucrats deciding how best to educate our children. We have already seen how academy freedoms have been fundamental in turning around failing schools – like Manchester Enterprise Academy, where results have almost doubled during its time as an academy.\n\nThat is why in the first 100 days we have brought forward legislation to transform all failing schools into academies and for the first time taken the power to convert coasting schools into academies too. But we have also seen how these freedoms can help all schools, with more than 3,000 good and outstanding schools already making the decision to become academies themselves.\n\nSo when Labour leadership contenders say they want to phase out academies, I say the opposite. I want every school in the country to have the opportunity to become an academy and to benefit from the freedoms this brings. So we will make it a priority to recruit more academy sponsors and support more great headteachers in coming together in academy chains. In doing so, we can extend educational excellence and opportunity to every school and every child in our country.\n\n100 days in, we are showing it is a Conservative majority government which has the ideas to build the One Nation vision and to deliver real social mobility in our country. We will not waste a second in getting on with the job and delivering the prosperity and security on which our future depends.","2015-08-15 08:32:53+00","653092548048400_1034997286524589",8],[8947,"The disruption in Calais is unacceptable.

But we need to understand the extremist threat we face, and why we must face it.\n \nIslamist extremism is an extreme ideology that seeks to destroy nation-states and invent its own barbaric realm. It often uses violence, mostly against Muslims. But it also promotes ideas hostile to our values of democracy, freedom and sexual equality, and promotes discrimination, sectarianism and segregation.\n \nTo tackle this, we need to understand why this ideology is proving so attractive. I argue that it is for four reasons. This ideology is not just subversive, but can seem exciting. It has often sucked people in from non-violence to violence. It is overpowering moderate voices within the debate. And it can gain traction because of issues of identity and failures of integration.\n \nThe right approach for defeating extremism follows from answering each one of these four points. In the Autumn, we will publish our Counter-Extremism Strategy, setting out in detail what we will do to counter this threat. But today I set out the principles we will adopt.\n \nFirst, we need to confront the ideology and expose it as a belief system that glorifies violence and subjugates people. We need to de-glamorise the extremist cause, especially ISIL. So we will use people who really understand the true nature of life under ISIL to communicate what it is like. We will counter ideology better on the ground through specific de-radicalisation programmes - and go much further in prison and online. We will also do more to tackle appalling cultural practices like FGM, forced marriage, so-called honour based violence. We need everyone - Government, local authorities, police, schools, all of us - to enforce our values across the spectrum.\n \nSecond, we need to tackle both violent and non-violent extremism. That means tackling groups and organisations who may not advocate violence, but promote the extremist narrative. We do this already - that's why we ban hate preachers and have redirected public funds away from bodies that promote non-violent extremism.\n \nBut we will go further, for example in education with measures to guard against radicalisation of children in so-called supplementary schools or tuition centres. We will introduce new, targeted powers to deal with those who peddle hatred. This is not just about changing laws - it is about all of us changing our approach to challenge extremism, including universities. We need the support of families and communities, and the Government will help where it can. I know some parents are worried their children might turn to this ideology, even seeking to travel to Syria and Iraq. So we will introduce a new scheme to enable parents to apply directly to get their children's passports temporarily cancelled.\n \nThird, we need to embolden different voices within the Muslim community. We are now going to actively encourage the reforming and moderate Muslim voices. This extremist ideology is not true Islam, but the extremists self-identify as Muslims. Denying that disempowers critical reforming voices. These are voices that are challenging the fusion of religion and politics, the scriptural basis which extremists claim to be acting on - and can provide an alternative worldview that could stop a teenager's slide along the spectrum of extremism.\n \nSo we will back those who share our values with practical help, funding, campaigns, protection and political representation. I am going to set up a new community engagement forum so I can hear directly from those who are challenging extremism. I also want to challenge broadcasters - who are free to put whoever they want on the airwaves - to consider giving the huge number of Muslims who represent liberal values, run credible charities and community organisations, the platform they deserve, including MPs.\n \nFourth, we need to build a more cohesive society, so more people feel a part of it and are therefore less vulnerable to extremism. I understand that it can be hard being young and Muslim, or young and Sikh, or young and black in this country. I know that while injustice remains - be it with racism, discrimination or Islamophobia - you may feel there is no place for you in Britain. But there is a place for you, and I will do everything I can to support you. We have made progress in recent years, but we need to go further.\n \nWe need to lift the horizons of some of our most isolated and deprived communities. So Louise Casey will review how to boost opportunity and integration - and bring Britain together as One Nation. This means looking at ensuring people learn English, boosting employment - especially for women - and state agencies working with communities to properly promote integration. We also need to look at segregation, because when people grow up and go to school hardly ever coming into meaningful contact with people from other backgrounds - it drives people apart. So we will take a fresh look at the sort of shared future we want for our young people.\n \nThis is how I believe we can win the struggle of our generation: countering the extremist ideology by standing up for and promoting British values; taking on extremism in all its forms - both violent and non-violent; empowering those moderate and reforming voices who speak for the vast majority of Muslims that want to reclaim their religion; and addressing the identity crisis that some young people feel by bringing our communities together and extending opportunity to all.\n \nThis is not an issue for one community or part of society - but for all of us. Time and again, Britain has refused to compromise on our values or give up our way of life. And we shall do so again. Together we will defeat the extremists and build a stronger and more cohesive country for our children and grandchildren and for every generation to come.","2015-07-20 13:04:06+00","653092548048400_1021890174501967",8],[8955,"Wishing a very happy and peaceful Eid to all the families and friends coming together to mark the end of Ramadan. #EidMubarak","2015-07-17 18:29:32+00","653092548048400_1020529407971377",8],[8957,"The fall in inflation while wages continue to rise is good for working people.

My speech today at Royal Air Force Coningsby:\n\nThank you very much for that welcome, and it’s a huge honour to be here as Prime Minister, as someone who has to think about all those operations that you go on and all the things we ask you to do.  It’s a real honour for me to come here today and say a very big thank you for all that you do .  And that was the first thing: a thank you, not just to the RAF, but a thank you to all our armed services for the work that you do.  Right now, we are flying air policing missions over the Baltic, we are picking people out of the Mediterranean Sea, we’re training troops in Afghanistan, we’re helping the armed forces of the Ukraine, we’re defeating Ebola in West Africa; there are so many things that our armed forces are doing on our behalf, and it really does give me huge pleasure to come here today and say a very big thank you.\n \nIt also gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to the skills and the courage and the bravery and the professionalism that you all have, and it’s a particularly good moment to do that as you all did so much over the weekend to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.  I think the whole country felt a huge sense of pride and ownership when those Spitfires, accompanied by the Typhoon, beautifully dressed up in Battle of Britain livery, flew over our capital city.  And it’s a reminder of what that was all about.  It was all about huge courage and professionalism.  It was all about recognising that, without strong defences, you have nothing as a country.  And it was all about also recognising that modern technology, in this case, the Spitfire, was absolutely key to saving our whole country.\n \nAnd that leads me to the third and final thing I want to say.  Because when it came – comes to that extraordinary courage at the Battle of Britain, what the few did was actually save the British way of life, and those lessons we learned then need to be applied now.  And that leads me to the third thing I want to say, which is about the future.  I think we need to recognise just what a dangerous and insecure and difficult world we’re living in, and that means it’s absolutely essential that we invest in the future of our defences.  Now, for the last five years, we’ve maintained the fifth-largest defence budget anywhere in the world, the second-biggest defence budget in NATO after the Americans, a budget of over £30 billion a year that gives us huge capabilities.  \n \nBut I’m absolutely clear we need to do more, and that’s what the Chancellor was talking about in the Budget.  And it wasn’t just talk; it was real money.  Not saying we’re just going to maintain the defence budget where it is, not saying we’re just going to keep up with inflation in terms of the defence budget, but we’re going to increase what we spend on defence between now and 2020 in real terms, over and above inflation, by the equivalent of as much as £6 billion extra.  I think that’s a really important vote of confidence in all our armed services, in the defence of our nation, and making sure that we have the capabilities necessary to keep us safe.\n \nNow, when it comes to how we spend that money, how we invest that money in the future of our defences, of course it’s right we have a Strategic Defence and Security Review, that we look at all the threats that we face, the threat of what is happening on the continent of Europe with Ukraine, the threats we face from cyberspace, the threats that we face with unstable and broken states in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.  But I would highlight one particular threat, which I think is such a threat to our country, to our way of life, and to peace and stability in our own country, and that is the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism.  We live in a world where young people, including people in our own country, are giving up the chance of a great life, of a great school, of a loving family, travelling halfway round the world to go and train as terrorists in the Middle East.  \n \nNow, of course, there are so many things that we can do to stop this.  We can confiscate people’s passports.  We can keep out the preachers of hate.  We can try to build a stronger, a more integrated country.  We can warn about the dangers of extremism.  We can do all of these things.  But in the end, we need to do something else as well, and that is to make sure that Britain, with her allies, can destroy the fanatical ISIL extremist state in Iraq and Syria.  We’ve done a huge amount already, and I want to thank the brave RAF crews who’ve flown so many missions over Iraq, more than any other country apart from the United States.  But I’m quite clear that, when it comes to the threats our country faces, this threat of extremist Islamist terrorism, a threat on our own streets and on our own people, as we saw tragically on that beach in Tunisia, this is the threat of our generation, the battle of our generation, the fight that we’re going to have, and I’m absolutely determined that the RAF, the Army, the Navy, will have the equipment, the means and the resources to deal with it.\n \nOne of the things that will mean is making sure that we have the drones, the spy planes, the special forces, the unique capabilities that make sure we can deal with this threat at its source.  All of you will play a huge role in this, and it gives me huge pleasure and a great honour to come here and thank you personally for all the work that you do.  Britain’s armed forces are an incredible example to our country.  The values you display, values of teamwork, values of loyalty, values of service, values of courage: these are British values and they’re values we all need more of.  So thank you for what you do.  Thank you for the celebration that you’ve given us over the last weekend with the Battle of Britain flight.  But above all, thank you for what you’re going to do with the extra resources that, quite rightly, the taxpayer will be putting in to defending our nation, defending our way of life, defeating Islamist extremist terror and standing up for Britain and British values all over the world.  Thank you.","2015-07-13 18:24:50+00","653092548048400_1018861878138130",8],[8961,"It was great to meet the England #Lionesses - who played so well in the World Cup.","2015-07-09 13:12:46+00","653092548048400_1016888371668814",8],[8963,"I have just met the Chief of the Defence Staff to explain how we'll protect defence spending going forward.  #SummerBudget","2015-07-08 17:37:58+00","653092548048400_1016542501703401",8],[8964,"","2015-07-08 10:26:44+00","653092548048400_1016383641719287",8],[8965,"My best wishes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Princess Charlotte's Christening today.","2015-07-05 12:16:54+00","653092548048400_1014975065193478",8],[8967,"It is only right that we remember the innocent victims of the terrorist atrocity in Tunisia with a permanent memorial.","2015-07-05 09:20:57+00","653092548048400_1014900501867601",8],[8969,"At midday I'll be joining millions stopping for a minute to remember the people murdered in Tunisia last week.","2015-07-03 07:27:22+00","653092548048400_1013982228626095",8],[8971,"I've asked for a national minute's silence on Friday at noon in memory of those murdered in the Tunisia terror attacks.","2015-06-29 16:21:27+00","653092548048400_1012113038813014",8],[8973,"I have asked for the flags over No10 to be flown at half-mast in memory of the victims of the terrorist attack in Tunisia.","2015-06-28 12:34:07+00","653092548048400_1011465842211067",8],[8976,"This morning I chaired a second Cobra meeting focusing on the attack in Tunisia.

It’s also about restoring the reputation of rights.\n\nLabour’s Human Rights Act and some of the decisions of the Strasbourg Court have given human rights a bad name. That’s a real shame.\n\nAfter all, it was this country that invented the whole idea of rights. Eight hundred years ago, on this day, something extraordinary happened on the banks of the Thames.\n\nThe king had been behaving like a bully — and there was no way for the people to rein him in. So some of his barons sat him down, and gave him a document to seal.\n\nIt set out the limitations of the monarchy and the basic rights of the people. It said that no one would again be above the law, not even the king.\n\nThis was the first time these principles had ever been written down. It was called Magna Carta and it went on to change the world. Everyone in this country should be proud of that.\n\nThat charter’s relevance remains. The sort of rights that flow from it — the right to life, the right not to be tortured, the right to a fair trial — these have helped Britain succeed over centuries.\n\nCountries that don’t have them aren’t succeeding and their people are crying out for them.\n\nWe should all be proud of what happened 800 years ago. So let’s celebrate today’s anniversary. Let’s put human rights right.\n\nTo those who say we can’t, I say of course we can.

We now have the mandate to deliver that renewal. And it starts with today's Queen’s Speech: a clear programme for working people, social justice, and bringing our country together – put simply, a One Nation Queen’s Speech from a One Nation Government.\n\nThe first task of a One Nation Government is to help all working people have security. And nothing is more crucial to that than a job. A new Bill will help to create two million more jobs this Parliament. That means there should be a job for everyone who wants one – in other words, full employment. To help people get those jobs, we’ll train them up; three million more will start apprenticeships over the next five years. We will also reward work by letting people keep even more of the money they earn – for the first time putting it into law that the Minimum Wage is and always will be tax free. That will be alongside a five-year tax lock which means there will be no income tax, VAT or National Insurance rate rises in this Parliament.\n\nFor too long we’ve been a two-speed country. Some could afford childcare; others could not. Some could afford a home of their own; others could not. A One Nation Government will change that. Our Childcare Bill will grant working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 3 and 4 year olds, and because of our reforms, for the first time, childcare will get proper tax relief. Our Housing Bill will dramatically extend the Right to Buy to the tenants of Housing Associations – putting home ownership within the reach of 1.3 million more families. We will require councils to sell high-value council houses and put the money into building affordable homes. We will get 90 per cent of suitable brownfield land ready for development. And we will build 200,000 discounted Starter Homes for young first-time buyers. All this will mean there are more houses for people to buy.\n\nThe second big focus of this Queen’s Speech is championing social justice. That starts with education: a decent schooling for every child, no matter where they’re from. Our school reforms in the last Parliament were bold; one million more children are now learning in good or outstanding schools. In this Parliament they will be bolder still: taking over and turning into Academies not just failing schools but coasting ones too, as part of our new Education and Adoption Bill; opening not just a few more Free Schools, but 500 more. Of course, there is nothing that embodies the spirit of One Nation and the cause of social justice more than our NHS, which is there for everyone, whoever they are, regardless of their ability to pay. So we will continue increasing spending on our health service, by at least £8 billion a year by 2020, and make it a truly 7-day NHS.\n\nWe will also continue our welfare reforms that help people into jobs, reducing the benefit cap further, to £23,000. Our reforms will incentivise work – so people are always better off after a day at the office or factory than they would have been sitting at home. That’s true social justice – not handing people benefit cheque after benefit cheque with no end in sight, but turning workless households into working households; the misery of unemployment into the purpose and dignity of employment; and the welfare system into a lifeline, not a way of life.\n\nThird, this Queen’s Speech will bring every part of our United Kingdom together. Our legislation will make sure this recovery reaches everyone, from the oldest industrial towns to the remotest rural villages. Our High Speed 2 Bill will help bring our great northern cities together in a Northern Powerhouse that rivals the biggest cities in the world.\n\nFor our different nations and regions to coexist as One Nation, people must have more direct power over the areas in which they live. So our Cities Devolution Bill will allow them to bid for an elected mayor, with far more sway over planning, transport, policing and health. We will have a Scotland Bill, a Wales Bill and a Northern Ireland Bill, and will put into practice our promises on devolution – making Holyrood the most powerful devolved Parliament in the world. Governing with respect means respecting the wishes of the English too. That’s why we will address the fundamental unfairness devolution causes in England, by introducing English votes for English laws. And the UK will have more control over its affairs, as we bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act. We will also legislate to have an EU Referendum before the end of 2017, putting the question to the British people for the first time in 40 years: the European Union – in or out. Underpinning all of this is security. With an Extremism Bill, an Investigatory Powers Bill and a Policing and Criminal Justice Bill, we will keep our people safe.\n\nThat’s our legislative programme. It’s challenging but doable; optimistic but realistic. It’s the bold first step of a One Nation Government – a Government for working people. And this is the Britain we’re setting out to create: a Britain where you can get a decent job, have a good education, buy a home of your own, have dignity when you retire, and feel safe and secure throughout your life. In the last Parliament we laid the foundations for that; in this Parliament we will use them to build something special. We’ve now got the majority we need. With this Queen’s Speech we’re going to get on and do it – for every single person in this great nation.","2015-05-27 15:29:26+00","653092548048400_990314177659567",8],[9006,"Congratulations to the people of Ireland, after voting for same-sex marriage, making clear you are equal if you are straight or gay.","2015-05-23 19:37:52+00","653092548048400_988429704514681",8],[9007,"I'm meeting EU leaders at the Riga Summit today.

Liberals can dream their dreams. But we in the Conservative party have got work to do.\"\n\nThe words of the late Iain Macleod were particularly relevant during an election campaign in which we saw Labour plotting new ways to spend people's money; the minor parties promising the earth with no way of paying for it; and only the Conservatives - the real party of working people - setting out the difficult decisions and bold reforms needed to make life better for people in this country.\n\nWe can't pretend there's not still a long way to go. We've halved the deficit as a share of the economy - but there's still half of it left to pay off. So we will continue to take the difficult decisions necessary to bring spending down and secure our economy.\n\nAs we go about doing that, I want people to be in no doubt: I said five years ago we were all in this together and, five years on, nothing has changed. That's why, for example, I've decided to freeze the pay of the ministers in the government. For me, that's just one step which sends out a clear signal: that as we continue knuckling down as a country, we will all play our part.\n\nBut the next five years will be about so much more than balancing the books. When we came to office in 2010, Britain was on the brink of disaster. As we return to office, after five years of a long-term economic plan and sacrifices by the British people, we're on the brink of something different - something special.\n\nWe can become a country where all hard-working people can get on; not a two-speed society where some can afford childcare and homes of their own and others cannot. We can become a country where all children get the education they deserve and no one settles for a life on benefits, so no one's background is a barrier to their success. We can become a place where every town, city and region has a stake in economic growth and political power, especially after so many have been left behind by previous recoveries and still feel remote from power. In other words, we can become one nation.\n\nThat, for me, sums up the task ahead. That's what we'll build in this parliament on the foundations we laid in the last. And it starts next week as we launch a programme of legislation that reaches right across our country, into every city, every community and every home.\n\nOur first aim is to help working people get on. The absolute key to getting on is getting a job. We created 2m jobs in the last parliament - more than the rest of the countries in the EU put together. In this parliament, we'll create 2m more - heading towards full employment: a job for everyone who wants one. We saw 2.2m people start apprenticeships in the last parliament. We'll help create 3m more, so our young people have the skills they need to do these jobs.\n\nWe'll also help people as they aspire to reach life's milestones. For those who want to buy a house, we're building more homes for them - plus helping them with their deposit and keeping mortgage rates low. For those who want to become parents and continue working, we'll deliver 30 hours' free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds. That's one nation: a country that says to people it doesn't matter who you are - if you work hard, you'll get the training, the job and the opportunities you need to succeed.\n\nOur second goal is social justice. Educational excellence shouldn't just be the preserve of the wealthy and the leafy suburbs. Free schools and academies are already putting paid to that notion: there are 1m more children now in good or outstanding schools and we've even got some inner-city free schools sending as many people to Oxbridge as some private schools.\n\nIn this parliament we'll go further. We won't just open a few new free schools, we'll open 500 more. We won't just take over failing schools as academies, we'll take over coasting ones too - because \"just enough\" is no longer good enough.\n\nAnd by lowering the benefits cap, we will make sure you're always better off in the office or factory than you are at home. \n\nOf course, there is nothing that embodies the spirit of one nation more than our National Health Service, which is there for everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. So we will continue increasing spending on the health service, by at least £8bn a year by 2020, and make it a truly seven-day NHS.\n\nOur third task is to ensure we are one nation when it comes to our economic success. Last year saw a remarkable achievement: the north grew faster than the south. With some of the biggest infrastructure programmes we've seen in centuries, like High Speed 2, and unprecedented power devolved to cities, we will build the northern powerhouse that rivals the great cities of the world, and put people in charge of their own destiny.\n\nAnd we will follow through on our commitment to devolution in Wales and Scotland too - making Holyrood one of the most powerful devolved governments in the world. A British Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act will restore common sense to our legal system. And a referendum will give people the chance to decide finally whether they want to remain in the EU or not.\n\nThis one-nation approach exposes a fundamental difference between us and Labour. They seem to believe that to help some people you have to hurt others, reaching into the pockets of middle earners or heaping debt onto future generations. This zero-sum politics is an affliction of the left. Look at the SNP - they believe you make Scotland stronger by weakening England.\n\nAs Conservatives, we have a core belief: you don't pull someone up by pulling another down. I'm not saying that means protecting the rich. Under us, the top 1% of earners pay 27% of all income tax - more than they ever did under Labour. And we recently increased stamp duty on the most expensive properties. What I'm saying is you can help people on low incomes without hitting people on middle incomes. We'll prove that in this parliament.\n\nWe'll get even more people out of poverty by training them, creating jobs, increasing incentives to work - and at the same time we will help all the people like teachers and police caught in the 40p tax bracket by increasing the threshold at which you start paying it to £50,000.\n\nSo these are the challenges facing us as we return to office, this time as a majority Conservative government. Our task five years ago was rescue and recovery; this time it's renewal - renewing the idea that we are one nation, in which all working people can succeed; people of all backgrounds have social justice; and the ties that bind all parts of our nation are strong.\n\nOur legislative programme is the first step in achieving that - for every single person in our country.","2015-05-24 09:47:46+00","653092548048400_988720797818905",8],[9008,"My message is clear - we can have a strong Scottish Parliament AND a strong United Kingdom.

By Friday, you will either have me as prime minister or Ed Miliband. From that choice flow two completely different directions for Britain’s — and your family’s — future.\n\nI’m asking for five more years to finish the job we have started. I’m asking for five more years to secure our economy, so we get more people into work, more young people getting trained rather than sitting on the dole, more couples into homes of their own, more pensioners feeling security and dignity in old age.\n\nThe long-term plan we have been seeing through is improving lives. The world looks at us today and is impressed at the progress we have made together — from an economy teetering on the brink to last year the fastest growing major economy in the developed world. Two million more jobs; a thousand people striding into a new job every single day we’ve been in office.\n\nThese are the indisputable facts. Am I saying everything’s fine now? Absolutely not. There is so much more we need to do. I am determined to get back to my desk so from day one we can start cutting the taxes of 30 million working people, taking the lowest paid out of tax, funding three million more apprenticeships, building 200,000 more homes for young people, putting more money and more doctors and nurses into our NHS.\n\nThat’s why I have been to every corner of our country making the case — to see this job through and save our country. Because the alternative Britain could begin on Friday, with Ed Miliband in No 10.\n\nOver the past five years I have faced him over the despatch box at PMQs on a Wednesday. And as our economy has grown, as jobs have been created, he has had nothing to say. Our remarkable national turnaround doesn’t fit his narrative. He thought our economy would go into a triple-dip recession — but our economic growth has exceeded expectations. He thought we would lose a million jobs — we’ve created a million jobs. He was wrong time and again. When I hear him attack this government and what we’re doing to fix the mess Labour left, it brings to mind an image of a firefighter putting out a blaze, with the arsonist who started it standing next to him and criticising the job he’s doing.\n\nBecause the fact is, Labour helped to break our economy and they would do the same all over again. Their plans do not add up. They want to borrow more money than we can afford. They want to tax more and would reach into your pockets to do it — not just the super rich, that won’t cover it — but your family’s hard-earned money. And they want to pile up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to repay.\n\nAnd with Miliband being propped up by the SNP — as is inevitable, whatever he says — we would be looking at complete and utter chaos in government, with the SNP holding the government to ransom every time there is a vote in the Commons — demanding more borrowing and higher taxes to pay for more welfare.\n\nThat is the simple, inescapable choice tomorrow: me leading a strong and stable government, or with Ed Miliband, the chaos of being held to ransom by the SNP.\n\nYour vote can and will make a difference at this election. It’s that close. There is no room for protest voting, or voting for marginal parties — unless you are happy to get Ed Miliband in No 10. All the numbers show it: a vote for Ukip is a vote for Ed Miliband. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Ed Miliband. A vote for anyone apart from the Conservatives risks Britain and its economic recovery grinding to a halt. So when you are standing in the polling booth tomorrow, ask yourself this question: who will take our country in the right direction long-term: the people who helped mend our economy, or the people who helped to break our economy?\n\nBritain’s future is on a knife-edge. It would be a tragedy if we threw away all the hard work of the past five years and went back to square one. Together we can keep strengthening our economy, creating more jobs, investing in our health service, giving more young people a chance to get on in life. All this is within our grasp. We are on the brink of something truly special in our country.\n\nThe future can be brighter but only if we stick to the plan, and only if Britain votes Conservative.","2015-05-06 08:17:12+00","653092548048400_980087588682226",8],[9031,"With one day to go, I'm crossing the country with this simple message of why people should vote Conservative:","2015-05-06 05:39:18+00","653092548048400_980043532019965",8],[9033,"With Chris Skidmore to meet the Asda nightshift in Kingswood, where 37,000 people have had their taxes cut since 2010.","2015-05-05 23:58:59+00","653092548048400_979885962035722",8],[9035,"Whatever your plans for the future, they are on the line on Thursday.\n\nThat's why I urge you to vote Conservative:","2015-05-05 19:31:03+00","653092548048400_979796295378022",8],[9037,"How to keep our economy strong - #VoteConservative on Thursday:","2015-05-05 15:41:52+00","653092548048400_979723775385274",8],[9039,"More jobs, more apprenticeships, more of your own money in your pocket - all key to our plan for the next 5 years.

The answer is that I’m adamant we don’t forget what we found when we came to office. Labour didn’t just leave a note; they left shops with their shutters closed; deserted homes with repossession notices in the windows; parents going home to tell their children they’d lost their job. That’s the real story behind the “no money” note – the human cost.\n\nOver the past five years we’ve been turning that around. People who were thinking of writing this country off are now writing about us as the success story of Europe – creating more jobs than all the other countries in the EU put together. Companies such as Hornby that sent production overseas are bringing it back to Britain – one in six according to one study. Industries that were on the wane, like brickmaking, are being revived. We’re a net exporter of cars once again. Last year we were the fastest-growing major economy in the West, and we’ve halved our deficit as a share of the economy as well.\n\nIt’s because we’ve strengthened our economy that we have been able to do other things. Two years ago, we became the first country in the G7 to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on overseas aid. That isn’t some achievement on a league table; it’s  people in the Democratic Republic of Congo getting the vaccinations they need, children in Sierra Leone living free from Ebola, families in Nepal hit by that terrible earthquake getting the medical care they need.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting the environment, we have made some big decisions as well. We’ve set up the world’s first green investment bank. We’ve more than doubled the amount of renewable electricity we produce, and increased renewables generation capacity threefold. We’re the ones pushing for other countries to sign up to carbon reduction targets. We’ve shown it can be done – you can grow the economy and cut carbon emissions.\n\nAt the same time as strengthening the economy, we’ve taken real steps to fight poverty. This has led to 600,000 adults and 300,000 children being taken out of relative poverty. But I want to do more. That’s why we brought in the pupil premium – additional money for the most disadvantaged children. We transformed the welfare system, so work always pays. And, crucially, there are now more people in work than ever before – and there is nothing more vital to eliminating poverty than having a job and bringing in a wage.\n\nIn the next Parliament we want to help those on low incomes even further. We’ll do that by increasing the personal allowance, the amount you earn before paying tax, to £12,500 – meaning no one working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will pay any income tax. And to help all those parents who struggle to pay the nursery fees, we’ll double free childcare for three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week.\n\nThis is what we’ve achieved; this is what we plan – but it’s all at stake this Thursday. The economy is on the ballot paper. But behind the economy is the environment needing investment; lives depending on British aid; children waiting to be lifted out of poverty; parents crying out for help in making ends meet. It would be impossible to address any of those things with the higher spending, taxes and debt Labour and the SNP are planning.\n\nThere is only one way to deliver the things that matter – and that’s with a strong economy. And there’s only one party that can deliver a strong economy: the Conservatives. So if you want to see Britain continuing on the right path – not back in the hands of the people who left us that shameful note – that’s what you have to do on Thursday: vote Conservative.","2015-05-03 13:11:36+00","653092548048400_978636415494010",8],[9056,"It’s a Bank Holiday weekend - when most people will have the chance to have a well-earned rest.\n \nAs you spend time with your family and friends, I’d urge all voters to take a moment and stop and think about the decision they have to make in just four days time.\n \nIt’s no exaggeration to say Britain will be making an historic choice.\n \nEd Miliband wants us to take a sharp turn to the left.  He sincerely believes more borrowing and more taxes will help you and your family. He is sincerely wrong.\n \nWorse - because he will lose so many seats to the SNP in Scotland - he cannot form a majority Government on his own.\n \nHe keeps trying to deny it - but it is a fact that he can only become Prime Minister with SNP support.\n \nNicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond will extract a heavy price for that support, vote-by-vote in the House of Commons.

Who do you want running our country – the people who helped to mend our economy, or the people who helped to break it?\n\nThe economy is the central, critical, irreducible core of this election. Everything depends on a strong economy. Every job; every pay packet; every business; every teacher’s salary in our schools; every heart operation in our NHS; every kind of help we can give the elderly and frail.\n\nThat’s why this week in the campaign is Economy Week. We will focus 100 per cent on the economy: what we will do and what is at risk.\n\nElect a majority Conservative government, and this is what you will get. On May 8, I would walk back into Downing Street, get back to my desk and immediately start driving through a plan of action for the first 100 days of a Conservative government. Whitehall will be called to attention. On day one, bills will start being drafted. And there will be some clear priorities for those first 100 days.\n\nFirst and foremost, a new law will be drawn up to ensure that no one working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays any income tax at all. This is about making sure that as we cut the taxes of 30 million people, the lowest paid are kept permanently out of income tax. It is a permanent measure to re-write not just the laws of this country but the values of this country. And it will be there as the centrepiece of the first Queen’s Speech of my new government.\n\nSecond, we will draft a bill for jobs and apprenticeships, to build on the extraordinary progress we have made. Two million jobs have been created since 2010 – but there will not be a moment of rest until we have reached our goal: two million more jobs; or full employment in Britain. On day one, we will start drafting a bill to include three million more apprenticeships, paid for by reducing the benefit cap to £23,000 – so that it is work, and not living on benefits, that really pays in our country.\n\nThird, we’ll press the button on a bill for enterprise. The past five years have seen 760,000 new businesses starting up. From the tech firms in Shoreditch to kitchen table start-ups in Birmingham, there’s been a return of the can-do spirit that has always helped these islands punch above our weight. This bill will help us reach our clear and stated aim: Britain the best place in Europe to do business by 2020. That’s on top of £10 billion of further cuts in red tape, trebling start-up loans to 75,000, and introducing our Help to Grow scheme, providing finance to fast-growing small firms.\n\nFourth, there will be a bill to deliver better schools – with more radical measures to ensure young people leave education with the skills they need. It will include new powers to force coasting schools, as well as failing schools, to accept new leadership, continuing the remarkable success story of Britain’s academy schools.\n\nFifth, there will be a bill to double free child care for working parents of three- and four-year-olds. With a Conservative government, they will get 30 hours a week – worth £5,000 a year – saying clearly to the working families of this country that we are on your side.\n\nAnd sixth: a housing bill to extend the Right to Buy to 1.3 million housing association tenants. Whatever the armchair critics say – usually from the comfort of a home they themselves own – this is about giving thousands more families the security of their own four walls, and I can’t wait to make it happen.\n\nOn top of all this, we will draft a European Referendum Bill; start the process of renegotiating in Europe on changes to welfare that will reduce immigration; and take the first steps to deliver a truly seven-day NHS.\n\nAll these priorities have a common thread running through them. They are about giving working people security at every stage of life.\n\nLet me put it this way. If our first term in office was about clearing up Labour’s mess and saving the British economy from ruin, our second is about building on that – so we can continue to turn the good news in our economy into something that makes a tangible difference to your life. The foundations are now laid, and we must build on them.\n\nOur vision is not some unreachable socialist utopia, it is a Conservative dream of strong families, real opportunity for young people, young couples starting out in a home they own together, the elderly well provided for, a good life within reach of everyone willing to work for it – all built on the solid foundation of a Britain living within her means again.\n\nBut that is just one side of the choice. May 8 could also mark the start of a new and unprecedented era in our country – the nationalists in one corner of Britain calling the tune for the rest of the UK as they hold Ed Miliband to ransom. We know the SNP’s tactics. Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond have made no secret of the fact that they will demand more spending – and therefore more borrowing, more taxes and more debt – from a weak Ed Miliband government.\n\nDon’t just take it from me. Independent observers at the IFS have said that debt would be £90 billion higher in 2020 under Labour’s plans. As they point out, “higher debt entails higher debt interest payments”.\n\nAnd what else does an unstable Ed Miliband-SNP government mean for you? Independent observers of the UK economy agree: higher mortgage payments – not to mention all the misery caused by lost jobs, businesses going to the wall, and higher taxes on families across Britain.\n\nSo this is the choice we’re laying out in this Economy Week: Ed Miliband locked in a death dance with the SNP, taking our economic recovery down with them; or the Conservatives back in government, with a clear plan, working every day to secure you and your family a brighter future.\n\nDon’t let them wreck all we’ve done. Make your voice heard – and vote Conservative to see this plan through.","2015-04-26 07:00:39+00","653092548048400_974767009214284",8],[9086,"I'm in Croydon with Gavin Barwell - a strong MP delivering for his area, including £20m funding for a new A\u0026E at Croydon University Hospital.","2015-04-25 08:23:51+00","653092548048400_974261875931464",8],[9087,"There's a clear choice at this election: a stronger economy, or more of what got us in a mess in the first place.","2015-04-24 17:31:30+00","653092548048400_973967479294237",8],[9088,"With our candidate Will Quince at Flakt Woods, Colchester.

That’s why I want to set out exactly the choice before you on May 7.\n\nI am not one of those politicians who says they ‘get’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private. Sitting in the House of Commons from 2001, I had a ringside seat on Labour’s complete failure on immigration – and it was infuriating.\n\nFake colleges, bogus visas, wide open loopholes, the wrong welfare incentives, sham marriages, an abject failure to deport foreign criminals, migrants bringing family members to Britain even if they couldn’t speak a word of English – a litany of failure. \n\nUnderpinning it all was contempt for the views of most British people. We all remember Peter Mandelson’s boast that Labour was practically ‘sending out search parties’ for migrants.\n\nThe mess took 13 years to create – and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around. Economic migration from outside the EU has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year. We have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories. \n\nThere are new charges for migrants using the NHS; there is no social housing unless you’ve been in an area for two years; and there is no housing benefit full-stop for EU jobseekers. Critically, we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out.\n\nOn top of all this direct action to control immigration, we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused; it was about British people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all, because of Labour’s welfare system. \n\nSo we have had a huge, unprecedented push on welfare and training, with two million young people starting apprenticeships, and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work.\n\nThe result of all this? Consider these remarkable two facts. Under Labour, for years, 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers. With the Conservatives, two-thirds of our job growth now benefits British citizens. That is a remarkable turnaround.\n\nI’m not saying there isn’t a lot more to do. It’s clear that, as our economy has taken off, the bigger issue has become migration from within Europe. And while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year, it remains the right ambition.\n\nSo why have many more EU migrants come here? Partly it’s our extraordinary economic success, with Britain creating more jobs than 27 other European countries combined. But large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare. These have been a powerful draw to EU workers.\n\nThat is why, in the manifesto we published last week, we had some very clear and hard-headed proposals. Elect a Conservative government, and I will start negotiating a new deal with Europe straight away. \n\nIt will involve: no benefits at all for EU jobseekers. If you haven’t got a job within six months, you’ll be required to leave. If you’ve got a job, you will get no in-work benefits until you’ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years. And no child benefit for children of EU migrants living abroad – ever.\n\nThis is what I’m seeking. I will fight, negotiate, do all I can to secure a better deal for Britain. And then we would put this to the British people in an in-out referendum in 2017.\n\nThe capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the Mediterranean at the weekend was absolutely shocking. Eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances, so it’s also right that Britain – not just a compassionate country but a strong one too – does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again.\n\nThat’s why I went to Brussels yesterday to help deliver a response. Of course, we need more search and rescue missions – and our Royal Navy is ready to play its part alongside other navies.\n\nWe need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery, deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration. \n\nOnly then will we properly get to grips with this situation – building confidence at home that people can’t come here illegally; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives.\n\nAll of this is a serious, grown-up plan for reducing immigration long-term. And it is based on some straightforward values. Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values.\n\nThis is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband.\n\nDo you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know.\n\nBut the facts of this election have changed – and it’s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It’s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it.\n\nAnd if you’re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win – and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government.

Postal votes land on doormats from tomorrow. If you are at home, pen in hand, about to make your mark, the Conservative pitch could not be more clear: stick with the plan and the team that is turning this country around.\n\nConsider how far we have come. In 2010 Britain was on the brink of bankruptcy; last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the developed world. A thousand jobs have been created every day and 760,000 new businesses have started up.\n\nAnd it is not just the British economy that has been revived; it is the British spirit. In offices and factories there is a new and palpable sense of drive. In schools across Britain there is a growing culture of ambition for every child. In the aspirations of everyone who has started a business from their kitchen table, there is the spirit that has always helped these small islands to punch above their weight.\n\nOur long-term economic plan is changing people’s lives. There are parents, now in work, who are earning a regular wage. There are teenagers beginning their adult lives not by signing on but starting an apprenticeship. Thanks to the Help to Buy scheme, tens of thousands more young people now have the security of their own home. Thanks to major rises in the state pension, pensioners now have more dignity and security in retirement.\n\nFor five years we have been laying the foundations of a better Britain — a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can expect to be rewarded for their efforts. The manifesto I launched last week was a plan to build on these foundations.\n\nWe would fund 3m more apprenticeships; build 200,000 starter homes for young first-time buyers; radically extend the right-to-buy scheme to 1.3m more families. There would be help to let you keep more of your hard-earned money — no 40p tax until you’re earning £50,000; the income-tax free allowance raised to £12,500. For young families, we would double the amount of free childcare available to working parents of three and four-year olds; 30 free hours a week — £5,000 a year. For those who have worked hard all their lives, we would take the family home out of inheritance tax.\n\nA Conservative government would protect spending on the National Health Service — and we can do that because we have a strong economy. That’s why Labour’s claims on the NHS ring hollow. You can have all the compassion and good intentions in the world, but if you don’t have a strong economy the NHS is in trouble.\n\nThat’s true of everything — good schools, decent pensions, the defence of the realm: it all depends on a strong economy. That’s why we must see through our long-term economic plan and keep clearing the deficit. With the Conservatives, Britain will be running a surplus in just a few years, living within our means, with our head held high.\n\nWe can get there by 2018. And don’t forget — by 2017, you can have that in-out referendum on Britain’s future in Europe. I will negotiate, get a better deal in Europe to reduce immigration, then put the decision to the British people. Your choice. And to anyone whose pen hovers over the Ukip box on their postal vote, let’s be clear: a vote for Ukip works directly against the Conservative party and makes a Labour government more likely. Can you imagine Ed Miliband getting a better deal for Britain in Europe? Or actually doing anything on immigration? No. That’s another reason this election matters so much.\n\nSo a Conservative majority government would be strong, decisive and accountable. We are currently just 23 seats short of that majority. That’s why your vote really matters. Because the alternatives look — frankly — chaotic.\n\nThe most likely alternative is Ed Miliband and Labour propped up by the SNP: the party that would bankrupt our country and the party that would break up our country. Nicola Sturgeon and I can at least agree on one thing; Ed Miliband must answer the question: will you rule out any form of deal that involves the SNP propping you up? He refuses to answer that simple question, so we can assume that is his plan. And it would mean total chaos. Labour would have to negotiate with the SNP vote by vote, day by day. Every time Ed Miliband wants to pass a bill he will have Nicola Sturgeon making a series of demands on him — the hostage-taker asking for more borrowing, more taxes and more welfare. The British people will pay.\n\nGovernment would end up as a dog’s dinner of haggling and backroom deals. Meanwhile our economy could come to a juddering halt.\n\nSo this is the stark choice facing people voting this week. Don’t think your vote doesn’t matter — or that a vote for one of the other parties makes no impact on the overall picture. It really does, more than ever before. A vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for Conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government. Vote for Ukip or the Liberal Democrats and you take Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon a step closer to Downing Street — and our government, economy and country a step closer to chaos.\n\nIt would be a tragedy if all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people these past five years were to be ruined by Labour and the SNP. Our growing economy didn’t happen by accident — but it can end by accident, if voters sleepwalk to an outcome they never wanted.\n\nSo if you are considering voting Ukip or Lib Dem, I urge you to think of the chaos of a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes. Only a Conservative vote in your local constituency will keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out and secure Britain’s future.\n\nIf you want a brighter future for you and your family, please use your vote carefully. Let’s see through the job we’ve started — and make our great country greater still.","2015-04-19 07:30:36+00","653092548048400_970609722963346",8],[9120,"We only need 23 more seats to avoid the risk of Miliband and the SNP.

In the past five years I haven’t been short of difficult choices to make, but I believe that, when we look back, people will see we made the right, long-term choices for Britain.\n\nYou saw it in last week’s budget. We chose a responsible, long-term budget over the usual pre-election giveaways. I remember sitting on the green benches in 2005, watching Gordon Brown at the despatch box, promising jam today and jam tomorrow, ignoring the fact that Britain was living beyond its means.\n\nWe have rejected that cynical approach. This budget did not contain any irresponsible extra borrowing. It did not use the boosts of low inflation and lower debt interest to fund giveaways. Instead we have directed our firepower to dealing with our debts. Back in 2010 we said we would get debt falling as a share of GDP by the end of this parliament. Many said it was impossible, especially given the eurozone crisis. But — by George — we’ve done it. What is more, we have set clear plans to get our country back into surplus by 2018. The sun is starting to shine — and we are fixing the roof.\n\nSo I hear Labour’s non-plans and short-term policies and I am deeply concerned. The security of millions of families rests on May 7, and yet major questions are left unanswered. How would Labour deal with our deficit? Just how much more would they borrow? What taxes would they increase? Where do they want to take our economy?\n\nThree years ago, Ed Miliband dashed over to Paris and said he wanted to follow the president: “We are in agreement in seeking that new way that needs to be found and I think can be found.” He wanted us to follow the same path as the new French government. But where has that path led? Unemployment over the Channel is almost twice what it is in the UK. Our economy is growing seven times faster than France’s. Imagine if Miliband had been free to pursue his French dream: the fallout would be felt in catastrophic job losses, falling living standards, eye-watering debt and fast-diminishing hope in our future.\n\nThe path we need is the path we are on — and it has two approaches at its heart, both of which were evident at this budget.\n\nOne: investing in tomorrow rather than today. This government has consistently put our long-term national interest over short-term gain. At budget after budget we’ve protected science and funded research. We’re building the first railway lines north of London since Victorian times, updating roads, investing in broadband. It would have been easier to give that money directly to people in tax credits or higher welfare. But we have always rejected the short-termism that held Britain back — and we did the same this budget. There were investments in science and technology; we are abolishing national insurance contributions for the under-21s, giving many more young people a brighter future; and making sure the foundations of our economy are strong means we can keep securing the future of public services like our NHS.\n\nTwo: rewarding those who work hard and do the right thing. For too long, those who did the right thing were punished. Savers got penalised for saving. Young people worked long hours in a fruitless quest to buy a home. Bankers boasted about paying less tax than their cleaners. Since 2010 we have been working to turn this around — from a fair state pension, to Help to Buy, to tax cuts for the lowest paid.\n\nThis budget built on that work. Another million of the lowest paid are being taken out of income tax. The savings tax is being abolished for 95% of taxpayers, so every penny you saved you will keep. A new Help to Buy Isa will mean more young people getting the keys to a home of their own: for every £200 saved, they will get an extra £50 — so if they save £12,000, they’ll have £15,000 to help get them on the housing ladder. Bit by bit, we are restoring the link between effort and reward.\n\nThese approaches are paying off. We are the jobs engine of Europe, with 1,000 new jobs created every single day since 2010. The deficit is down. We have the lowest inflation on record. Last year, ours was the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world.\n\nIt’s not just a bigger economy we are building, but a better one. Manufacturing is growing rapidly. Over the last year, the north grew faster than the south. Yorkshire created more jobs than the whole of France. And critically, the rewards of recovery are being spread more fairly. The share of tax paid by the richest is rising. The hardworking, lowest paid are feeling the wind at their backs as they pay less in tax — or none at all. The independent experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies have confirmed that living standards in 2015 are forecast to be higher than when we took office. In homes across our country there is a growing sense of hope and security.\n\nAll this presents a very clear choice to you on May 7: between competence and chaos. This is not about dry and dusty budget forecasts, but people’s lives.

That plan is working. Day by day, month by month, Britain's getting stronger: jobs are on the rise, the deficit's down, the economy's growing and wages are going further.\n\nAnd there's more good news for family budgets, with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent. \n\nAt a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable, these latest figures are a reminder that we're on the right track – and that doing things differently would put it all at risk. \n\nIt's a reminder that only the Conservatives have a plan to build a stronger economy, improve living standards and make families across Britain more financially secure.\n\nWe want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn. It is individuals – not governments – who know best how to spend their money. \n\nThat's why, in Government, we've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over £10,000 – and we will go further in the next Parliament. \n\nThat's why we've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years, saving a typical family £10 each time they fill up. \n\nThat's why we've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension, which will be £950 higher than it was in 2010. \n\nThat's why we're introducing tax-free childcare – helping out parents with hefty childcare bills. That's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills, putting more money in hardworking taxpayers' pockets.\n\nDon't just take me by my word. Judge me by my record in Government: we've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years, and will deliver 3 million more in the next five – giving young people the skills to go out and get a well-paid job. \n\nWe're backing business, industry and enterprise – creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008.\n\nWe're getting Britain building again, helping young people to own their own home. We've already announced 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers under 40. And we will now help first-time buyers save for a deposit.\n\nA strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation. And a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life. \n\nMums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children; grandparents who've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives, get a job, get a home, and make something of themselves.\n\nA Conservative Government after May 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you, your family and for Britain. \n\nStep by step, milestone after milestone.

Click 'share' to let friends know.\n\n— A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLAN THAT IS WORKING: The British economy has been transformed.\n\nOut of the ashes of the Great Recession, last year we were the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world. More than 1.8 million extra people are in work. The deficit has been cut in half. This didn’t happen by accident.\n\nIt’s because we’ve got a long-term economic plan – and for the sake of your job, your family and your future, we’ve got to stick to that plan.\n\n— 1,000 JOBS A DAY: Since the Conservatives have been in Government, 1,000 new jobs have been created every single day. We’ve created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together. So if you want Britain to keep on as the job-creating factory of Europe, then keep Conservatives in government.\n\n— CUTTING YOUR TAXES: Because we’ve lifted the income tax allowance to £10,000, chances are you’ve had a tax cut – like 26 million other people in our country. Why have we done this?\n\nBecause you worked hard for that money – and Conservatives think you should keep more of it.\n\nSo we’ve made a big commitment: Next time we’ll raise the tax-free threshold even higher – to £12,500. People working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will pay no income tax at all. Labour and the Lib Dems threaten to raise your taxes, we will cut them.\n\n— GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE A DECENT START: So far we’ve got a million more children learning in good or outstanding schools – and by investing £7 billion next time, we will create many more brilliant school places.\n\nOn top of that, we will fund three million more apprenticeships, so that instead of heading for a life on the dole, our young people are learning a trade and getting on in life.\n\n— MAKING BENEFITS MORE FAIR: Our welfare system was a soft touch for too long. It sent out the terrible message that it was better to stay idle than to work.\n\nSo we brought in a benefit cap – and next time we would reduce that cap to £23,000 per household. Why? Because many hard-working taxpayers in our country earn less than that.\n\nThis is about real fairness between who puts in and who takes out. The age of something for nothing is over.\n\n— DIGNITY AND SECURITY IN OLD AGE: For years pensioners were treated poorly. The people who fought the Nazis and built our country were fobbed off with pitiful 75p increases in their pension. It was a disgrace – and we’ve turned it around.\n\nThe State Pension is up by £950 a year. Benefits including free bus passes and winter fuel allowance have been kept.\n\nNext time we’d keep the pension rising by earnings, prices or 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest. We’d keep those free benefits – and keep ensuring dignity and security for the older generation.\n\n— MORE HOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE: We’ve pulled out the stops to get more people on the housing ladder. Help To Buy has got 77,000 so far into a home of their own.\n\nNext time we’d build Starter Homes across our country – especially for first-time buyers under 40.\n\nTens of thousands more people will have the brilliant feeling of standing in their own home, keys in hand, knowing “this is mine”.\n\n— PROTECTING THE NHS: It is one of the best things about being British: Whoever you are, however much money you’ve got in the bank, you can get help if you are sick.\n\nThat’s why we have protected the NHS budget, employed 9,500 more doctors, 7,500 more nurses, started a Cancer Drugs Fund and boosted dementia care and research. Next time we would make sure – once again – that healthcare spending goes up.\n\n— CONTROLLING EU MIGRATION AND HOLDING AN EU REFERENDUM: I will go to Brussels with a clear plan: No more benefits for EU jobseekers; if you haven’t got a job after six months, you must leave; no in-work benefits or social housing unless you’ve been here for four years.\n\nThen, in 2017, a Conservative Government would put our future in Europe to the British people in a referendum. In or out – you decide.\n\n— BACKING OUR BRAVE TROOPS: In an age of Islamist extremism and threats from across the world, it is vital that Britain’s forces have the best kit.\n\nThat’s why Conservatives plan to invest at least £160 billion in new hardware over the next decade, including seven new Astute-class submarines, the Joint Strike Fighter, and two vast aircraft carriers to patrol the seas and keep us safe.\n\nWe’ve taken money from fines imposed on the banks into veterans’ charities, and made the Military Covenant the law of the land. We’ve always backed our troops – and we’ll keep it up.","2015-03-01 13:24:30+00","653092548048400_943173052373680",8],[9242,"I am shocked and sickened by the callous murder of Boris Nemtsov  as he walked in the heart of Moscow last night.

His life was dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the Russian people, to demanding their right to democracy and liberty under the rule of law, and to an end to corruption. He did so without fear, and never gave in to intimidation. He was greatly admired in Britain, not least by his friend Lady Thatcher, who visited him in Russia and who would have been appalled by today's news. The courage of Nemtsov's life contrasts with the utter cowardice of his murder.\n\nI extend my condolences to Boris Nemtsov's family and friends.

The production line had ground to a halt at the height of the Great Recession, and all the staff had been made redundant, save two, who had stayed to look after the machines for when – and if – they started up again. There I was, pushing the “on” button; and, for the first time in seven years, the kilns lit up, the cogs cranked into action – and the town was making bricks once again. More to the point, people who had lost jobs and struggled with part-time work had got back those full-time, properly paid jobs.\n \nThis isn’t just the story of one factory; it’s the story of our country over the past five years. Industries that were on the wane are being brought back to life. Companies whose orders were drying up are striding into new markets, from Colombia to Mongolia. Manufacturers that left Britain under Labour’s excess of taxes and regulation are returning to our shores – one in six, according to a recent report. We’ve got more tech companies starting here than anywhere else in Europe. We’re making more cars in Sunderland than in the whole of Italy. There are 760,000 more businesses in our country than in 2010. The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival, and it’s creating an incredible 1,000 new jobs every day: more than the rest of Europe put together.\n \nHow did this happen? First, because men and women kept their heads down and steered their businesses through some rough years. But I also think the Government has played its part, by putting enterprise at the heart of our long-term economic plan to turn Britain around. From this April we will have the joint most competitive corporate taxes in the G20. We’ve had thousands of entrepreneurs getting their ideas off the ground using Start-Up Loans. We’ve cut NI contributions and are scrapping the jobs tax for under-21s. We’ve halved the deficit as a share of the economy and made it easier to get finance. Add to that our planning reforms and our drive on exports and investment, and you can see Britain taking its place as one of the best countries in the world to start and grow a business.\n \nI didn’t do this because I think all businesses are perfect. Remember: I’m the one who signed deals with big firms so they exercise their social responsibility, such as Subway and Costa being transparent about calorie content. I’m the one whose Government put tax and transparency on the agenda at the G8 and is leading the world on countering tax evasion and tax avoidance, on making everyone pay their share; and our 40 changes to tax law have helped recoup £85 billion more in taxes this Parliament. And I’m the person who will go further: who will tackle the so-called “Double Irish”, where big firms move their profits from country to country to avoid tax.\n \nI did this because I understand that businesses are the principal job creators in our country. There are some politicians who think jobs are created in Whitehall by ministers. Conservatives understand they are created by brave men and women who are willing to put their neck on the line and start a new enterprise; whose great idea starts turning over money, and before long provides new opportunities and jobs for other people. For us, supporting businesses is not an end in itself; it’s a means to an end – an end that is more jobs for our people, more financial security for our families, and a brighter future for our communities.\n \nHere’s something else Conservatives understand: it’s successful enterprise that keeps our public services going. This year, businesses paid more in corporation tax to Treasury coffers than our spending on schools, defence or transport. Nothing illustrates better the importance of enterprise. So when our opponents try to portray the Conservatives as just on the side of business, they’re wrong. We’re on the side of hard-working people who want a job; who want to put food on the table; who want to get on, own a home and get decent public services.\n \nLabour don’t get any of this. Forget their comical turns this week – berating Boots one minute; trying to lavish it with praise the next; going on television to talk about how some of their best friends are businessmen, then forgetting their names. Frankly, that’s a sideshow. This chaos betrays something much deeper about Ed Miliband and Labour – something that should strike fear in every family in the country: they have a sneering hatred of business.\n \nIt was Ed Miliband, in one of his first major speeches as Labour leader, who took it upon himself to dub some businesses as “predators”. It was Ed Balls who said that one of the first things he would do as Chancellor would be to slap higher corporation tax on some of our biggest employers. As new analysis today shows, this policy alone could cost 96,400 jobs. That statistic demolishes one of their economic arguments; they say they would deal with the deficit by growing the economy, but with their anti-business policies, there would be no jobs and no growth. For Britain’s hard-working families, that would mean thousands more parents back on the dole, children going without, ambitions being stifled, all because Labour are ideologically blind to the link between enterprise and people’s prosperity.\n \nSince January, the big choices at the general election have been laid bare. On business, the choice is again between competence and chaos. It’s the competence of us and our long-term economic plan that’s securing Britain’s future; or the chaos of Labour, who pose a clear threat to every single hard-working taxpayer – to their jobs, their security and their future. Labour’s Britain is one of higher unemployment, more children growing up in households without a role model who works, and more of the misery we saw during their Great Recession.\n \nOurs is a nation that is the best place to do business, and, as a result, will hit our target of full employment: a job for everyone who wants one. A nation where we have the businesses paying the taxes we need, so we can cut people’s taxes, protect our NHS, improve our schools and run a budget surplus that will shield our economy from future shocks. I’m not saying the job is done – it certainly isn’t – but we are getting there. Bit by bit, brick by brick, we’re building a Great Britain truly worthy of the name. On May 7, we have to stay on this path – because that’s the only way to guarantee security for you, your family and our country.","2015-02-08 08:31:54+00","653092548048400_931757260181926",8],[9277,"Great to be on the set of #Emmerdale today.
