I respected him when he saved half a billion dollars for crucial after-school programs that give our most vulnerable youth the best chance of fulfilling their potential, but as I spent more time with him, my respect only grew.\n\nHe and his wife Beverly were some of the greatest supporters of our men and women in uniform that I have ever met. Each time I visited Washington, the Youngs insisted they bring me to visit our wounded warriors at Walter Reed and Bethesda Hospital as they came home from war. They would walk through the halls, stopping in each room and remembering the name of the patient. They inspired me with their commitment to our heroes.\n\nMy thoughts are with Beverly, who was his greatest supporter and is a great American in her own right, and the rest of his family.","2013-10-19 02:19:41+00","9269711759_10151901692141760",11],[17239,"Let's have some fun.

I wanted to inspire others to join me in my fitness crusade.\n\nWhen I began my career, if you asked someone where the nearest gym was, they would most likely look at you like you were a serial killer. If you were lucky, they would point you to some faraway dungeon with a few barbells and some weights.\n\nToday, it’s hard to find a strip mall or a building without a fitness center, and for the most part, you would never mistake a modern gym for a torture chamber. We’ve come a long way, but I know this is not a crusade that has an obvious end point. We will always have to keep pushing forward and fighting to show people the benefits of health.\n\nI met Adam and Roman because they share my commitment to health and fitness. When I decided to get back into the fitness game, I sought out the best and brightest experts in the field.

Jack was literally an apostle for fitness, and his gospel inspired billions all over the world to live healthier lives.\n\nFrom the moment I met Jack on Venice Beach in 1968, I knew I'd never meet someone with so much energy – to keep himself in the best shape imaginable, but also to motivate everyone around him to get moving, eat well, and be the best version of themselves. He was on a mission to make a healthier world, and he wouldn't be content until he'd touched every person he could. He did just that, through his fantastic television shows, his innovative products, and his contagious spirit. He was so adamant about fitness that it was never about just himself and being the fittest man in the world, it was always about how he could make everyone else join him. In fact, I'm sure I'm not alone in still using my Jack LaLanne Power Juicer every day. \n\nAbove all else, Jack was a man of action. When asked to work on the President's Council for Physical Fitness, he dove into action. When he wanted to find a way to get people eating more fruits and vegetables, he just invented an easier way to put 12 carrots into one cup of juice. When you asked him to research food supplements, he started poring over the science that very second. When I called on him to work on my Governor's Council on Physical Fitness, it didn't matter how old he was, he showed up for duty right away. Whenever I or anyone else needed any help to promote fitness he was there. I remember one time I was on a plane with him – he was 92 at the time – and he said \"I'm so stiff, I've got to stretch my hamstrings.\" And he reached his legs right up to the ceiling of the plane. He was 92! Right away, I thought, \"Jack isn't just stretching, he is inspiring the rest of us.\" Believe me, I didn't miss a set in my workout that evening. And that's what he did for the entire world throughout all of his 96 years.\n\nNow Jack, for so long the most energetic man in the room, can finally rest, knowing that he left the world a better and fitter place than he found it. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jack's wife Elaine and his entire family during this difficult time.","2011-01-24 19:51:32+00","9269711759_10150125512206760",11],[17768,"Emergency on a Plane: The Sequel.

How can you watch this and make any excuse not to train, to better yourself, to keep moving forward?\n\nBut there's more. They remind all of us that fitness is our right.\n\nWe all have the right to be physically fit. Young, old, injured, healthy, rich, poor, it doesn't matter. Regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, and everything else, we all share this human body. We may look different outwardly, but we are made of the same things. \n\nSo I'd challenge everyone in our fitness movement: what are YOU doing to ensure that EVERYONE can access a fitter and healthier life? What are you doing for six year-olds like Daniel, who I met last week through Make-A-Wish and became serious about training when he recovered from chemo? What are you doing for athletes like the ones in this video to make your gym accessible? What are you doing to open your arms to everyone?\n\nFitness is a right, and I hope you're inspired by this video not only to better yourself, but to improve our fitness crusade, to be inclusive, to reach out and inspire.\n\nFor more info on Team Some Assembly Required:\n\nwww.teamsomeassemblyrequired.com\n#TeamSomeAssemblyRequired \n#TeamSAR #SARNation","2016-03-08 22:37:23+00","9269711759_10153844561186760",11],[16681,"Watch my rally for my good friend John Kasich!

For Todd.\n\nI can tell you that I’ve talked to Todd twice now, and the feeling is like nothing else. I am not exaggerating when I call him my hero. The feeling after our talks is better than winning my first Mr. Universe. It’s definitely better than a red carpet.\n\nEach of you has that power. It might be someone struggling to buy their groceries in front of you in line. It might be an older person that needs help carrying their gifts. How many kids are spending the holidays in the hospital and would light up if you brought a gift—or even just read a book to them? Every day, we have these chances, and it’s easy to miss them when we are looking down at our machines. This week, let’s not let the opportunities pass.\n\nEven if you’re the Grinch, do it for selfish reasons. I learned a long time ago that giving back is the most addicting feeling in the world. It’s why I worked with Special Olympics, visited every state when I was the Chairman of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and founded After-School All-Stars more than two decades ago.\n\nIt doesn’t take money or fame or a grand gesture. It just takes a little time and thought. And we all benefit. I know when I heard that another redditor had sent Todd a t-shirt, it brightened my day.\n\nEnough talk. Just do it. Then come here and share so we can inspire more people. For Todd. Or as you kids say, #ForTodd.\n\nBut really, for all of us.

Joe Weider was a titan in the fitness industry and one of the kindest men I have ever met.\r\n\r\nI knew about Joe Weider long before I met him - he was the godfather of fitness who told all of us to \"Be Somebody with a Body.\" He taught us that through hard work and training we could all be champions.  When I was a young boy in Austria, his muscle magazines provided me with the inspiration and the blueprint to push myself beyond my limits and imagine a much bigger future. I know that countless others around the world found motivation in the pages of his publications just as I did, but as I read his articles in Austria, I felt that he was speaking directly to me and I committed to move to America to make my vision of becoming the best bodybuilder, to live the American dream, and to become an actor a reality.\r\n\r\nJoe didn’t just inspire my earliest dreams; he made them come true the day he invited me to move to America to pursue my bodybuilding career. I will never forget his generosity. One of Joe’s greatest qualities is that he wasn’t just generous with his money; he freely gave of his time and expertise and became a father figure for me. He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in \"Hercules in New York\", even though I barely spoke English. As my career took off, he was always nearby, giving advice, promoting my movies or my crusade as the Chairman of the President's Council on Fitness in the pages of his magazines, and appearing at my fundraisers and events when I decided to run for Governor. He was there for me constantly throughout my life, and I will miss him dearly.\r\n\r\nHe leaves behind a fantastic legacy of a fitter world. Very few people can claim to have influenced as many lives as Joe did through his magazines, his supplements, his training equipment, and his big-hearted personality. Joe was known for urging everyone, “Exceed yourself,” and there is no question that throughout his life, he did just that.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts and prayers are with his extraordinary wife, the love of his life, Betty, and all of his family and friends.","2013-03-23 18:11:59+00","9269711759_10151510122966760",11],[17368,"Read this.
