Sixty years ago yesterday the guns fell silent across the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe armistice that ended hostilities in the devastating war that had raged across this country for more than three years had come into effect.\n\nThis terrible conflict, that claimed three million lives, began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea launched an all-out invasion of its southern neighbour. The United Nations responded promptly to this act of blatant aggression by asking its members to help defend the Republic of Korea. Sixteen nations answered this call by sending combat troops and others provided non-combatant support.\n\nWithin days New Zealand offered the services of two Royal New Zealand Navy frigates. In July New Zealand decided to commit a ground force based on an artillery regiment to serve as part of the United Nations Command. New Zealand's contribution was small, but was a significant one for our country. In total about 6000 Royal New Zealand Navy and New Zealand Army personnel served in Korea between 1950 and 1957 of whom 45 lost their lives.\n\nContinue reading: http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1693-Speech-to-New-Zealand-National-Service,-United-Nations-Memorial-Cemetery,-Busan,-South-Korea.html","2013-07-28 03:11:16+00","12635800428_10151803162210429",21],[37641,"At the Armistice Ceremony at the Seoul Cemetery remembering when the guns fell silent 60 years ago yesterday.","2013-07-27 02:50:36+00","12635800428_10151801309270429",21],[37642,"Speech: Address to Armistice Commemoration Ceremony, Seoul, South Korea\nhttp://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1692-Address-to-Armistice-Commemoration-Ceremony,-Seoul,-South-Korea.html\n\nMadam President, distinguished guests, honoured veterans, ladies and gentlemen\n\nIt is an honour to address you on behalf of the countries invited here today to commemorate, with our Korean partners, the 60th anniversary of the Armistice Agreement which ended hostilities in the Korean War.\n\nWe are here to remember the heroism and the sacrifices of Korean and allied troops from 21 nations large and small, including my country New Zealand, which answered the call of the Korean government and the United Nations.\n\nWe remember with gratitude those who gave their lives to defend freedom, as well as the many thousands who were wounded.\n\nWe also thank the veterans of the conflict, many of whom are here today.\n\nYour selflessness and courage in the most difficult conditions will never be forgotten.\n\nContinue reading: http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1692-Address-to-Armistice-Commemoration-Ceremony,-Seoul,-South-Korea.html","2013-07-27 02:45:28+00","12635800428_10151801296235429",21],[37756,"This morning I cut the ribbon to officially open Allied Pickfords’ new $4.1m warehouse in Christchurch.","2013-05-22 22:10:36+00","12635800428_10151670052065429",21],[37757,"I'm with the team at the Copthorne Commodore Hotel in Christchurch to celebrate the opening of 20 new rooms","2013-05-22 21:26:49+00","12635800428_10151669982535429",21],[37634,"Speech to Kiwi Chamber Seoul, South Korea\nhttp://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1694-Speech-to-Kiwi-Chamber-Seoul,-South-Korea.html\n\nIt’s great to be back here in Seoul.

It is at times like this that residents look to local government not just for resources and assistance, but leadership and reassurance.\n\nI’d like to congratulate Wellington Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown, and other local government representatives in the affected districts, for their responses to this latest series of earthquakes.\n\nI’d also like to publicly pay tribute to Christchurch’s out-going mayor Bob Parker. Bob showed great leadership in Christchurch during some exceptionally difficult circumstances and his commitment to the city during its darkest hours will be his legacy.\n\nThank you, Bob, for everything you have done.\n\nThe example he set, and the response from local government in recent days with the latest earthquakes, again underlines the importance of the leadership role local government plays not just during earthquakes, but during every other type of emergency like floods or heavy snowfalls.\n\nOur four priorities\n\nWhen I spoke at your last conference in Queenstown, I outlined the four priorities that the National-led Government is focused on this term. A year on, I can report that these priorities are still driving our work programme and they are central to the future prosperity of this country.\n\nTo recap briefly, our first priority is to responsibly manage the Government’s finances.\n\nTaking on more debt has been appropriate to support the economy and cushion New Zealanders from major shocks like the recession, the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes.\n\nBut, as households around the country know, carrying substantial debt is neither comfortable nor financially prudent.\n\nSo we have committed to returning the Government’s books to surplus in 2014/15 and we are on track to achieve this.\n\nWe are also on track to reduce net government debt to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.\n\nAnd we are achieving this while still spending $5.1 billion on new initiatives over the next four years – funded, in part, by reprioritising existing spending.\n\nOur second priority this term is to continue building a more competitive and productive economy.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains uncertain.\n\nDespite this, New Zealand is in good shape, especially when you compare us with other developed countries. The economy grew 2.4 per cent last year, making us one of the faster-growing countries in the OECD.\n\nForecasts are for growth to continue at between 2 and 3 per cent a year. As business confidence increases, more jobs are being created, and wages are going up, which is good news for New Zealand families and communities.\n\nOur third priority is to deliver better public services to New Zealanders within tight financial constraints. We are doing that across the board.\n\nIn particular, we have a four- to five-year programme of delivering in 10 specific target areas. Recently, we reported our progress to New Zealand. I’m pleased to say that in all 10 of our target areas, we’ve made progress.\n\nOur fourth and final priority is to rebuild greater Christchurch, our second-largest city. This is the largest economic undertaking in New Zealand’s history, but it is progressing quickly, and that is great to see.\n\nBetter Local Government reforms\n\nLast year when I spoke to you, we had just begun work on passing the Bill that enabled phase one of our Better Local Government reforms.\n\nThese reforms are designed to give you the tools to keep rates affordable, set clear financial prudence requirements, and give councils more tools to better manage costs.\n\nWe are putting a focus on stronger governance, improved efficiency, and better fiscal management at the local government level.\n\nWe are aware that LGNZ has been focused on improving governance with your members, too. I thank you for your contribution towards this. Your announcement of a partnership between LGNZ and the Institute of Directors on professional development training for elected representatives is a welcome step forward.\n\nChanging the way you operate, and bringing a sharp focus on better leadership is not unique to local government. Governments at all levels across the world are being forced to reconsider what ‘business as usual’ means in this new global economic environment.\n\nLiving within our means is the way of the future. Businesses, households and families are taking notice of this new reality.\n\nThe first phase of Better Local Government reforms is helping local government to play its part in the belt-tightening that has been a reality for government, businesses, households and individuals over the past few years.\n\nAt the end of last year, these reforms passed into law.\n\nThe second phase of reform is now underway. There is an even bigger focus on efficiency, with the work done by the Efficiency Taskforce and the Local Government Infrastructure Expert Advisory Group. The recommendations from these two bodies have formed the basis for more policy decisions.\n\nFurther to this, the local government reorganisation reforms have enhanced the ability for councils to amalgamate, and are provoking a lot of discussion and activity in a number of communities.\n\nChanges to structure can lead to better governance. As we can see with the Auckland city amalgamation, processes are streamlined, and efficiencies across Auckland have been found.\n\nAs I have said before, the Government will not force amalgamations. What we wanted with this reform was to make it easier for communities to achieve structural change if they decide that was the right move for their community.\n\nNo-one knows better than you the importance of your sector, and how much of a difference local government can make to New Zealand’s economic success. That’s why it is important we get these reforms right.\n\nReforming the RMA\n\nIn February, the Government released a discussion document that contained a comprehensive package of resource management reforms.\n\nThe way the current resource management processes are operating is costing us all in time, money and lost opportunities. The systems have become cumbersome, uncertain and highly litigious.\n\nDelays and uncertainties from the RMA means potential new jobs are not being created, houses are more expensive and communities have no idea what to expect in their neighbourhood.\n\nFundamentally, the second set of RMA reforms are about providing greater confidence for businesses to grow and create jobs. The RMA reforms will bring greater certainty for communities to plan for their area’s needs, and strong environmental outcomes as our communities grow and change.\n\nGovernment heard hundreds of submissions and held more than 50 meetings throughout the country on these reforms. The Government expects to be in a position to progress the resource management reforms in the next month.\n\nHousing\n\nAn issue I would like to address in particular with you today is housing.\n\nHousing is a very important issue. We all know the rising cost of housing is a great concern in Auckland and, to a lesser degree, Christchurch. We also know it is an issue around the country.\n\nThe Government’s view is that we can improve the supply side of the housing market so that housing becomes more affordable.\n\nThat is why we are looking at establishing Housing Accords, in partnership with local government, to create special housing areas.\n\nThe first of these Accords is with Auckland, and what it does is give Auckland Council the tools it needs to get on and consent thousands more sections.\n\nHousing Accords aim to streamline the planning and consenting process and get central and local government working more closely together on housing development.\n\nWe’ve set targets within the Auckland Accord to ensure the city’s housing supply and affordability issues are addressed. As a result of the Auckland Accord, we are targeting 39,000 new homes over the next three years, which is a significant increase in the number of homes currently being built in Auckland.\n\nI want to turn now to recent debate on the Reserve Bank’s proposal for loan to value ratios (LVRs) for residential mortgages.\n\nI have made my thoughts clear – first home buyers are a priority for the Government – that remains my view.\n\nIt is worth however, putting some context around the actions the Reserve Bank is considering.\n\nAbsent of any other alternative, then rapidly increasing house prices may see the Reserve Bank raising interest rates, which will affect everyone - all mortgage holders and businesses, whereever they are in the country, as well as the Government.\n\nThat is certainly not in the best interests of first home buyers.\n\nAnd higher interest rates would put upwards pressure on the Kiwi dollar, which would hurt exporters.\n\nEven with LVRs introduced, interest rates may ultimately rise anyway, but the intention with these loan to value ratios is to provide the Reserve Bank with other tools to dampen demand.\n\nHousing bubbles overseas, like in the US where subprime mortgages were hugely popular, had in the end a very negative impact on the American economy.\n\nIt left US banks and many homeowners very exposed and it had a dramatic negative flow-on impact, as we all saw.\n\nSo it’s an issue that has to be taken seriously here in New Zealand.\n\nIf it is left unchecked some buyers could find themselves substantially overexposed in an overvalued market. And we all know what happens if those values start to fall.\n\nSo, this issue is of serious concern. I remain of the view that all tools have to be considered. Demand-side issues are largely the purview of the RBNZ, which is independent, and they will in the end have to make a decision.\n\nThe Government is keen to see all New Zealanders have the opportunity to buy a house.\n\nPart of the mix is ensuring the economic fundamentals are right, people can get a job, and there is enough land supply. And affordable interest rates are part of the mix, too.\n\nSo this is a debate about getting the balance right between ensuring poeple have the opportunity to buy a home, and ensuring we don’t have problems with the banking system - with all the negative economic impacts that would entail.\n\nThe New Zealand cycle trail\n\nTurning now to another great example of a partnership between central and local government is the New Zealand Cycle Trail, which is almost 90 per cent complete.\n\nEleven Great Rides are now open, with nine more planned before the end of the year.\n\nOver the past five years, 318,000 cycling tourists have visited New Zealand, providing a significant boost for regional tourism.\n\nThe trails would not be possible without the support of local government, regional tourism organisations and local businesses. $30 million raised in co-funding arrangements demonstrates the significant commitment of communities to their local trails.\n\nI know that those involved in several trails have recently held workshops to plan how to maximise the returns to their region now that the construction phase is nearing completion. Thinking outside the square will enable local trails to create revenue and increase the economic benefits to their regions.\n\nEvery trail that has opened so far has led to spin-off benefits for the local community. New cafes, cycle transfer businesses, and growing demand for accommodation nearby cycle trials is great for our local communities.\n\nLocal elections\n\nI’d like to turn briefly to the local elections coming up in October. To those who are standing again for election, I wish you the best of luck on October 12. And to those who are not standing for re-election, thank you for your service to your communities.\n\nI want to say that the work you do, and the services that are provided by the organisations you represent, are important. Your communities rely on you.\n\nIt’s vital that when the opportunity comes along for the public to exercise their right to vote for their elected representatives, they take the time to do so.\n\nVoter turnout at the local body elections in 2007 was the lowest turnout since the restructuring of local government in 1989. In 2010, voter turnout improved slightly to 47.5 per cent.\n\nIt would be great to see that turnout improve again at this election and I encourage New Zealanders to have their say.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s important for New Zealand’s future economic success that we work well together. I believe our relationship is in good heart, and I know that you are not afraid to tell me your thoughts on central government’s programme.\n\nWhile central and local government have different core functions, both are facing similar challenges. And those involved in both are committed to leaving New Zealand in better shape than when we found it.\n\nAnd just as central government does, local government also needs to work on delivering better services to New Zealanders within tight financial constraints.\n\nI appreciate the work you do, and the challenges you face. We are committed to supporting you.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to work closely with local government across New Zealand.\n\nThank you and enjoy the rest of your conference.","2013-07-22 22:07:26+00","12635800428_10151792006660429",21],[37659,"Media Release: Prime Minister welcomes Royal baby\nhttp://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=41560\n\nPrime Minister John Key today congratulated Their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, on the birth of their first child, a boy.\n\n“This is wonderful news for Prince William and Catherine,” says Mr Key.\n\n“The birth of a child is a time of great joy and excitement, and I know they will make excellent parents.”\n\nMr Key also extended his congratulations to The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, and The Queen and Prince Phillip, on the arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family.\n\nNew Zealand's official gift to the Royal couple is a hand-spun, hand-knitted fine lace shawl, similar to the one that New Zealand gave when Prince William was born.

It will help grow our new and emerging markets, and it will help build on the phenomenal growth we've seen from existing markets such as China and Australia.\n\nFollow this link to watch my latest video, where I explain how more tourists coming to our shores means more jobs for New Zealanders, and will contribute to higher growth in our economy. http://youtu.be/RB4kGPXCYJI","2013-04-24 02:00:10+00","12635800428_10151621288615429",21],[37807,"Post-Cabinet press conference - on the Mighty River Power issue and more.","2013-04-22 10:52:56+00","12635800428_10151618498275429",21],[37809,"We will partner with tourism business and invest $28m over four years to co-fund business innovation and growth http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1645-Budget-2013-Partnering-with-NZs-tourism-businesses.html","2013-04-21 06:23:28+00","12635800428_10151616378570429",21],[37774,"Announcing a new Housing Accord with Housing Minister Nick Smith and Auckland Mayor Len Brown http://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=40955","2013-05-10 03:09:08+00","12635800428_10151648293455429",21],[37775,"John Key: Improving Healthcare\n\nWhen National came into office in 2008, we worked extremely hard to ensure our health service was delivering the high level of service we expected it to.

Exports of goods and services, including tourism and international education are vitally important for our economy,” says Mr Key.\n\n“As my recent visits to China and Latin America have demonstrated, there is huge potential for New Zealand in these and other growth markets. My Government is committed to continuing its work with the private sector to encourage and facilitate more growth in exports.\n\n“This year’s Budget will see a significant investment in these areas, to help drive even more focus on international growth areas.\n\n“Today I am announcing that, as part of this package, we will be investing an additional $158 million over four years into tourism,” says Mr Key.\n\n“Achieving growth in tourism earnings requires targeted new investment to position New Zealand as a high value destination in markets with real potential for growth.”\n\nIn the year ended March 2012 tourism generated $9.6 billion of revenue and was 15.4 per cent of export earnings. It was 3.3 per cent of GDP and employed 6.2 per cent of the workforce.\n\n“Later this week when I attend New Zealand’s premier tourism conference, TRENZ, I will announce details of where this $158 million will be invested,” says Mr Key.\n\nContinue reading: http://johnkey.co.nz/archives/1640-Budget-2013-Investing-in-internationally-focused-growth.html","2013-04-16 00:43:03+00","12635800428_10151607883720429",21],[37863,"New video and newsletter: Building stability in Afghanistan \n\nRecently I announced the men and women of our Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) will be leaving the Bamyan province in Afghanistan.\n\nNew Zealand troops have played an important role in shoring up the security of Bamyan, and the wider country.

Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully was also at the meeting.\n\nMr Key has met President Xi before, when he visited New Zealand as Vice-President in 2010, and on a previous visit to China.\n\n“It was great to meet with President Xi again and reaffirm the strong relationship between our two countries,” says Mr Key.\n\nChina is New Zealand’s second-largest trading partner, the second largest source of tourists, and the largest source of international students coming to New Zealand to study.\n\nAt the meeting, Mr Key and President Xi discussed a wide range of topics and reconfirmed the target of doubling two-way goods trade between China and New Zealand by 2015.\n\nMr Key and then Premier Wen Jiabao set the target of doubling two-way goods trade to NZ$20 billion by 2015 when Mr Key visited China in 2010. \n\n“Businesses are on track to achieve this, and my meeting with President Xi provided an opportunity to reconfirm that target,” says Mr Key.\n\n“In 2012, total two-way trade totalled NZ$14.6 billion. New Zealand has traded more with China over the past five years than the combined value of all our previous trade with China.\n“We were also pleased to inform President Xi that New Zealand will be upgrading its diplomatic presence in China to reflect the increasing importance of our relationship,” says Mr Key.\n\n“New Zealand will open a new Consulate-General in western China.\n\n“From later this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also take over leadership of the Consulate-General in Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong.

It is estimated to receive about a third of New Zealand’s exports to China.\n\n“These decisions reflect the range and growth of New Zealand political, trade, tourism and education interests in China and will support their further development,” says Mr Key.\n\nMr Key and Xi Jinping also discussed New Zealand’s proposal to establish a marine protected area in the Ross Sea, Pacific and East Asia security, and other regional and international issues.","2013-04-07 20:29:30+00","12635800428_10151595259595429",21],[37848,"I’ve just arrived in Guangzhou to join with the NZ delegation on our five-day long official visit to China.","2013-04-07 13:54:29+00","12635800428_10151594691290429",21],[37850,"Today I met Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in China.

The initial three-month phase will see 6,086 officers using the new technology, rising to 6,500 by mid-2014.\n\nAn 11-month Police pilot indicated officers would be able to save about 30 minutes each eight-hour shift by using the new technology – about 520,000 hours per year based on the initial rollout to 6,086 officers.\n\n“Put another way, that’s equivalent to about 345 extra frontline Police being more active and visible in our communities,” says Mr Key.\n\nContinue reading: http://www.johnkey.co.nz//archives/1597-Police-roll-out-new-technology-to-fight-crime.html","2013-02-13 01:56:24+00","12635800428_10151496827960429",21],[37944,"The new technology initiative for Police will save about 520,000 hours a year – which will be reinvested into crime prevention activities.","2013-02-12 22:12:15+00","12635800428_10151496537855429",21],[37946,"Later this morning Police Minister Anne Tolley and I will be announcing a new technology initiative for Police.","2013-02-12 20:31:10+00","12635800428_10151496393525429",21],[37948,"I called Lydia Ko to congratulate her on her win at the NZ Open at Clearwater.
