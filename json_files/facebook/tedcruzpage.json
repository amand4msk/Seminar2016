With this address he is now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists, even as he proclaims “America first,” he puts K Street lobbyists first. He is never going to fight the system, he is the system. He and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. She has made her millions from inside and Donald Trump has made his billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. Both are part of the culture of foreign policy for personal gain.","2016-04-27 19:14:25+00","69983322463_10154090111692464",1],[61,"It’s been 48 days since the last #GOPDebate.\n\nIndiana deserves a debate, Donald J.

In 1979, upon his arrival, he kissed the tarmac. And the dust that had all but covered the churches ruptured as the bells rang out – one after another. Soon millions of people lined the streets. And when Saint John Paul II addressed the crowds before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he spoke these immortal words: ‘On how many battlefields has that solider given witness to the rights of man, indelibly inscribed in the inviolable rights of the people, by falling for \"our freedom and yours!\"\n\nAnd he asked for the Lord’s blessing upon the land:\n\n\"Let your Spirit descend.\nAnd renew the face of the earth,\nthe face of this land.\"\n\nThat is the redemption message. By His sacrifice we are made new. And as we remember the gift of salvation on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, let us be so bold to ask the same. We face a different enemy than in 1979 – but one with the same goal – to snuff out the light of freedom.

We cannot afford to lose the Supreme Court for generations to come by nominating or confirming someone that a dealmaker like Donald Trump would support. Washington dealmakers cannot be trusted with such crucial lifetime appointments.\n\nI proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief – our advice and consent – that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office. The People will decide. I commend Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley for holding the line and ensuring that We the People get to exercise our authority to decide the direction of the Supreme Court and the Bill of Rights.","2016-03-16 18:27:12+00","69983322463_10153969933292464",1],[406,"#DuckingDonald strikes again.

In her public role as first lady, she brought elegance, dignity, and wisdom to the White House as she so graciously hosted dignitaries from around the world. She also poured her life into helping the afflicted, especially those gripped by drug and alcohol addition. She pioneered programs to lift Americans out of addiction and restore hope to them and their families.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, her faithfulness only multiplied as she stayed by his side. She always remained the love of his life, and after his passing she carried on his legacy – and most of all his faith that this nation would always stand for good in the face of evil, defeat those who meant her harm, and remain a shining city upon a hill.\n\nToday, Heidi and I mourn with the Reagan family, and we lift up prayers of gratitude for the many years of devotion Nancy gave to her husband and her country. We remember especially how dedicated she was to preserving the memories of her husband. She will be deeply missed. And we feel the sorrow of the nation. But we remember too that like her husband Nancy was a person of faith. Ronald Reagan said once he could not “imagine life without her.” It is good that they are together again.","2016-03-06 19:49:04+00","69983322463_10153939412562464",1],[497,"\"Today Ted Cruz dominated in Kansas.

In less than a year’s time, conservatives across this country have come together from all walks of life – tea party conservatives, libertarians, women and men concerned for our safety, young people, small business owners – and they have changed the course of the 2016 election.\n\nThe Washington Cartel said we didn’t have a prayer. Well, actually, that’s where for many of us this began. We believe that 2016 isn’t simply another election year. It’s a chance to change the course of this nation: To once again have the courage to stand up to our enemies, to call them by their name, and to defeat ISIS. To restore every citizens’ God-given liberties, especially their right to live in accordance with their faith.

The attack in San Bernardino was the worst Islamic terrorist attack on American soil since the attack on Ft. Hood in my home state of Texas.\n\nAt the time of that attack, the President insisted that it was a case of “workplace violence” ignoring the clear evidence that it was a terrorist attack. I was proud to have been able to help ensure that each of the victims of the Ft. Hood attack finally received a Purple Heart for their sacrifice.\n\nThe reality is that what President Obama, Secretary Kerry and Hillary Clinton have done has not worked. Their policies have in fact made the world more dangerous. It is time for a dramatic shift in both foreign and national security policy.\n\nTonight when President Obama addresses the nation, I hope that he will acknowledge and take responsibility for the failed policies of his administration and will take concrete steps to reverse the damage done.\n\nHe should start by finally calling our enemy by its name. Denying who the enemy is will only delay their defeat. The terrorists call themselves the Islamic State. So tonight, I challenge President Obama to finally acknowledge the enemy that the United States and our allies face. It is radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nSecond, after naming our enemy, the President should lay out a bold strategy to defeat ISIS, not to try to change the subject to gun control or the compliant media headline to global warming, but rather lay out a plan for decisive action for victory over evil.\n\nThird, Americans want to know how this administration intends to keep them safe here at home. Border security is national security. We can no longer accept a border that is not secure and the President should announce the immediate steps he will take to ensure that it is.\n\nWe now know that one of the attackers was here on a visa. She went through the same background checks that the President says the refugees from Syria will go through. We also know that ISIS has made it clear that they intend to infiltrate the refugees in order to get to the United States. That can’t happen.\n\nThe President should place an immediate moratorium on refugees from countries with a significant al Qaeda or ISIS presence, such as Syria. I’ve introduced legislation to make this happen; it is not a desired step, but a necessary step for the security of the United States.\n\nFinally, the President should resist using terrorist attacks to try to take away the rights of law-abiding Americans. Millions of Americans have chosen to protect themselves and their families by purchasing a firearm. This is their right; indeed protecting their families is their obligation. The President should be looking to stop those who would do us harm – not attempting to take away the constitutional liberties of millions of innocent Americans.\n\nThe American people know that the threat is very real. They will be looking for the President to address restoring America’s role in the world, defeating ISIS, securing the border, and keeping them safe from radical Islamic terrorism here at home.\n\nThey want to know the specific steps the President intends to take to keep them safe.\n\nWe need American leadership, and we need America winning again. The world does as well.\n\nI look forward to the President’s remarks.","2015-12-07 00:28:31+00","69983322463_10153743725147464",1],[788,"#CruzCrew: Don't miss out on the chance to save 20% at http://store.tedcruz.org with our #CyberMonday sale!","2015-11-30 18:05:38+00","69983322463_10153732040712464",1],[722,"We need a president who will stand up and unequivocally defend the national security interests of this country!\n\nMiss my speech at The Heritage Foundation live?

On this holiday, we remember the miracle that enabled a freedom-loving people – led by the heroic Maccabees – to defeat the oppressive dictator Antiochus so that they could once again freely worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the eight days of Chanukah, the Jewish people commemorate their liberation from oppression and the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. As the Talmud teaches, God delivered ‘many into the hands of the few, strong into the hands of the weak, and evildoers into the hands of the righteous.’\n\nToday, the Jewish people, together with freedom-loving people around the world, once again find their religious faith and liberty under attack from radical forces of oppression and intolerance. Whether it is the BDS movement on college campuses, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, or radical Islamic terror in Israel and around the world, we need modern-day Maccabees to stand together and push back against the forces of evil. As a nation founded by a people seeking religious liberty, America stands with the Jewish people both at home and abroad in protecting the light of faith and liberty.\n\nThe victory of the people of Israel is a testament to God’s providence. On these nights when Jewish families around the country and the world celebrate with latkes, lighting the menorah, and playing dreidel, Heidi and I join with you to recognize, ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Sham,’ a great miracle happened there. We only need look at our nation’s heritage to know that great miracles have happened here too, ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Po,’ and will continue to happen with God’s blessing.

This is an evil that does not discriminate between French, German or American, Christian, Muslim or Jew, soldier, football player, or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious, totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies, and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary.\n\nWe must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS’ ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris, we need to take immediate, commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means.\n\nSuch steps, however, are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America—that it is, in effect, signing your own death warrant.","2015-11-14 02:08:13+00","69983322463_10153702166812464",1],[873,"Horrific reports coming out of Paris.

A few days later, another Jewish family was walking in the Old City of Jerusalem after praying at the Western Wall when a Palestinian terrorist went on a stabbing attack. He murdered the father along with another courageous man who rushed to the scene to the family’s aid. Both men leave behind their wives and nine children. In addition to the four murdered, many more Israelis have been seriously wounded from car-ramming, rock-throwing, and brutal knife and screwdriver stabbing attacks in what appears to be a fresh horror—an epidemic of low-tech, brutal attacks by militants who are acting on their own initiative.\n\nThese attacks have been incubated by the continued incitement and glorification of violence by the Palestinian leadership, most recently by President Mahmoud Abbas during his address at the United Nations General Assembly. He still has yet to categorically condemn these attacks. It is long past time for the United States and the international community to hold the Palestinians accountable for their incitement and support for terrorism, including through the financial payment to Palestinian terrorists who are jailed in Israel for committing acts of terrorism.\n\nIn yet another stark reminder of how closely our nations are connected in this fight, the father murdered last Thursday, Eitam Henkin, was a dual Israeli-American citizen. The terrorist who killed him did not care, as his sole intent was to kill Jews, not to engage in a political process. There is no moral equivalence between Palestinian terrorism and the obligation of Israel to act in defense of its people. To the Israeli people, especially those who are victims of terrorism and their families: I proudly stand in solidarity with you during this challenging time.","2015-10-09 22:04:28+00","69983322463_10153638995517464",1],[1119,"The Obama Administration has been caught flat-footed as Putin's actions threaten to inflame and destabilize an already acute crisis.\n \nEnough already.

The worst terrorist attack on our homeland taught us two things: that our oceans would not protect us from a determined enemy in the 21st century, and that radical Islamic terrorism was not a regional annoyance with limited capacity, but a real and present danger to our very way of life.\n\nToday, we remember the victims: the people in the twin towers of the World Trade Center, that emblem of America’s economic power, and the first responders who charged in to save them. The military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon working to keep our country safe. The innocent passengers on those four doomed flights, some of whom heroically sacrificed themselves to minimize the casualties on the ground.\n\nBut as we pause in their honor, we must also look forward. The hard fact of the matter is that today, we again face a gathering threat from radical Islamists who may have changed their name or affiliation, but who are unchanged in their determination to degrade, and ultimately destroy, the West.\n\nToday, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism is still very much as real as it was fourteen years ago. From Nidal Hassan yelling ‘Allahu Akbar’ before he murdered fourteen innocent people in Ft. Hood, Texas, to the Boston marathon bombings, a beheading in Oklahoma, and the attack in Chattanooga that left four marines and a sailor dead.\n\nSeptember 11th, 2015 should be more than a day of reflection and remembrance. It should be an opportunity to resolve that we will not allow political correctness or complacency to lull us into the same false sense of security that al Qaida exploited fourteen years ago. We owe it to the memory of those whose lives were lost to squarely face the ongoing, virulent threat of radical Islamic terrorism, unafraid to call it what it is, as we defend ourselves and the founding principles that make America the greatest force for good in the world.","2015-09-11 13:08:30+00","69983322463_10153579343377464",1],[1279,"Help support our campaign from wherever you are -- download the #CruzCrew app today:  http://tedcruzapp.org","2015-09-10 22:36:09+00","69983322463_10153578144192464",1],[1281,"This fight is about reigniting the promise of America -- about restoring our \"Shining City upon a Hill.\"\n\nJoin us: www.tedcruz.org","2015-09-10 16:07:09+00","69983322463_10153576783162464",1],[1283,"A nuclear Iran is the greatest national security threat facing America.

This is disingenuous at best. The blame should be laid squarely at the door of the vicious, radical Islamism that is tearing communities apart from Libya to Syria and Iraq, creating the terrible circumstances that are causing the migrants to flee their homes.

Manufacturing has steadily declined during Obama’s presidency, and the industriousness that has empowered workers and pioneered innovation is fading under his watch.\n\nBut with strong Presidential leadership, we can turn things around quickly: we can eliminate onerous regulations, repeal Obamacare, simplify the tax code, and welcome job creation in every sector – from energy to manufacturing to agriculture. We can champion hardworking Americans. If we stand together for working men and women, we will reignite the promise of America.","2015-09-07 13:25:59+00","69983322463_10153567957052464",1],[1301,"Get ready for fall with our new line of #CruzCrew camo gear: https://store.tedcruz.org/product-category/hunters-gear/","2015-09-06 16:28:49+00","69983322463_10153566080357464",1],[1304,"The Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran lifts sanctions and gives the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism access to funds.

Under the terms of this deal, Iran will retain all of its centrifuges, one-third of which will continue to spin. Rather than the most intrusive inspections regime in history that we were promised, IAEA inspectors must petition the mullahs to visit sensitive sites, and wait for two weeks for their permission. In a final, shocking concession, the United States will support lifting of the United Nations arms embargos that restrict the Iranian ballistic missile program and arms trafficking. And in return, billions of dollars of economic relief will flow to Tehran.\n\nYet, in his remarks this morning, the President glossed over the truth about Iran’s world-leading state-sponsorship of terrorism that is violently destabilizing the region, and would grow more deadly should the Iranians get a nuclear bomb. He failed to mention American citizens, Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati and Jason Rezaian, who continue to languish in Iranian prisons or Robert Levinson, who is still unaccounted for. For them, today is no ‘opportunity to move in a new direction’ as the President claimed. We owe it to our fellow Americans elevate, not ignore, their plight, to demand their swift and unconditional release by the implacably hostile regime that holds them.\n\nEven by the low standards of the Joint Plan of Action, this is a staggeringly bad deal. It is a fundamental betrayal of the security of the United States and of our closest allies, first and foremost Israel.\n\nBut thankfully, it is not a done deal. We still have an opportunity to tell the truth about what Prime Minister Netanyahu called today a \"bad mistake of historic proportion.\"\n\nCongress will have 60 days to review it, and the American people will have 60 days to tell their elected representatives just what they think of it.

Today I am calling upon former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose leadership this bad deal began, and other Presidential candidates to join me in demanding that Secretary Kerry stop negotiating with this hostile and violent enemy of America and immediately leave Vienna.\n\nWe are now on the eve of what is by my count the fifth \"deadline\" for a comprehensive nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is still unclear if this arbitrary date will be more respected than any of its predecessors, but it hardly matters at this point. By any metric, the negotiations have failed—at least from the perspective of America’s national security. All of our key priorities—stopping enrichment of uranium, removing stockpiles of enriched uranium, and exposing and eradicating the potential military applications of Iran’s nuclear program—have been ceded to the Iranians.\n\nPerhaps there was some hope for this process two years ago when Hasan Rouhani became president of Iran. Given Iran’s dire economic circumstances caused by the unprecedented program of international sanctions, we could have demanded concessions from the mullahs before any negotiations took place–notably the release of all Americans unjustly held in Iran and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. Once negotiations began, we could have made it clear the above conditions would have to be met before sanctions relief. And rather than stove-piping Iran’s nuclear program from its abysmal human rights record, aggressive state sponsorship of terrorism and ballistic missile program–the only purpose of which is to deliver a nuclear weapon–we should have insisted these issues be addressed to our satisfaction as well.\n\nUnfortunately, in their unseemly eagerness to make a deal, President Obama and Secretary Kerry have squandered all our advantages and ceded all our priorities. There is no possibility for an acceptable agreement at this point because there is no incentive for the Iranians to make one. Our first priority must be to end this farce; the best we can do is cut our losses.","2015-07-06 23:36:09+00","69983322463_10153421910912464",1],[1714,"Thank you for your tremendous support, #CruzCrew!","2015-07-06 18:11:21+00","69983322463_10153421172602464",1],[1715,"Help us lead the fight for a #FullRepeal of Obamacare: http://bit.ly/1HHvW4W","2015-07-06 14:44:31+00","69983322463_10153420633752464",1],[1716,"I’ll be in West Des Moines a little later today, Monday, July 6, and I’d like to see you there!\n\nBarnes and Noble\n1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n4550 University Avenue\nWest Des Moines, IA 50266\n\nHope you'll join us and bring a friend!","2015-07-06 12:36:49+00","69983322463_10153420383032464",1],[1720,"Great question, Jeff!

But I don’t believe that. Everywhere I go, I see it in their faces and hear it in their voices. Americans want to believe again.\n\nOn this July 4th, I want to share with you my hope for America.\n\nIn the summer of 1776, Patriots gathered to dissolve the political bonds they had with England and declare their independence. The bold call for independence presupposed that the colonists were equal in station to the British Empire. They listed their grievances as justification for the split.\n\nThe fifty-six signers from the thirteen colonies affixed their signatures to the document. It could only mean one thing – war. Indeed, the American Revolution came.\n\nToday, we live out the Founder’s promise to America – that a free people pursuing their dreams would lead to limitless possibilities.\n\nMy father came to America from Cuba in 1957. He had very little money, and spoke little English. My Irish-Italian mother was the daughter of working class parents. Both my parents worked hard and were the first to graduate from college. In a single generation, their son became a United States Senator and now I am running for President of the United States. That could only happen in America.\n\nWhat I understand is that story is not unique. Most Americans have a similar story in their family history.\n\nThese stories demonstrate how America is truly the land of limitless opportunity. The Fourth of July always reminds me of the opportunity America gave my family, and I ask myself, \"What have I done today to ensure that same opportunity exists for future generations?\" We’re an exceptional nation, and it is up to each of us to keep it that way.\n\nHappy Fourth!","2015-07-04 12:22:33+00","69983322463_10153414588757464",1],[1724,"I’ll be in Greenville, SC, tomorrow, Saturday, July 4th, and I’d like to see you there!\n\nThe Westin Poinsett Ballroom\n3:00 pm - 5:00 pm\n120 S Main St\nGreenville, SC 29601\n\nHope you'll join us and bring a friend!","2015-07-03 20:43:32+00","69983322463_10153413153822464",1],[1726,"How are YOU celebrating #IndependenceDay this weekend? #July4th","2015-07-03 15:57:01+00","69983322463_10153412596662464",1],[1728,"The American people are tired of politicians not telling the truth  #ATimeForTruth","2015-07-03 01:02:26+00","69983322463_10153410956492464",1],[1730,"We're seeing a grassroots tsunami rise up to break the #WashingtonCartel and turn this country around! #ATimeForTruth","2015-07-02 19:32:15+00","69983322463_10153410415067464",1],[1732,"I've spent two decades fighting to defend religious liberty, and I will never, ever, ever shy away from defending the religious liberty of every American.","2015-07-02 15:51:18+00","69983322463_10153409884787464",1],[1734,"Many thanks to Rush Limbaugh for sharing one of my favorite stories about Justice Clarence Thomas from #ATimeForTruth!","2015-07-02 01:30:47+00","69983322463_10153408359972464",1],[1736,"ICYMI: I spoke at length with Hugh Hewitt about many of the stories to be found in #ATimeForTruth.

In 2008, despite having done nothing to merit it, the Hermit Kingdom was removed from the list in the hopes that the concession would bring them to the negotiating table. Seven years later, an emboldened North Korea has become more dangerous – testing nuclear weapons, engaging in clandestine nuclear programs with Iran, launching cyber attacks against America, and most recently, threatening our homeland with a nuclear weapon. Furthermore, North Korea was intercepted in 2013 trafficking weapons from none other than Cuba.\n\nThe State Sponsors of Terrorism list is not a bargaining tool. It is a tool to measure the bad behavior of hostile regimes and hold them accountable for it. But the Obama Administration seems to want an embassy in Havana more than they want to do the hard work of securing the American people.\n\nThis dangerous recklessness must stop.

At the behest of those seeking to use unelected judges to strike down democratically enacted marriage laws, courts across the country have seized for themselves the authority to redefine marriage. Today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases raising the question of whether such judicial intrusion is constitutionally proper. It is not.\n\nFor millennia, the union of a man and a woman has been the fundamental building block of society, and the Judeo-Christian value of traditional marriage is a cornerstone upon which the strength of our Nation rests. Before 2004, no U.S. state recognized same-sex marriages. And to preserve the traditional understanding of marriage, thirty states have amended their state constitutions to define marriage as between one man and one woman, and in total over forty states have passed laws or amendments to protect traditional marriage.\n\nThis effort to redefine marriage by judicial fiat poses a serious threat to the religious liberty for those who embrace traditional marriage. We are seeing businesses shut down and individuals threatened with costly lawsuits simply because they do not agree with same-sex marriage. There was a time when the defense of religious liberty was an issue of bipartisan agreement. Yet now the progressive left is seeking to force their view of marriage upon all Americans, regardless of their religious convictions.\n\nResorting to federal courts to further that effort is unconstitutional. Under our Constitution, courts do not make law. This is why I am proud to have filed an amicus brief in support of the right of states to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. It is my sincere hope that the Justices of the highest court of our land will rule on the side of the U.S. Constitution and let the people, through their elected State representatives, continue to define marriage as it has been understood since the beginning of time.\n\nIn case that does not happen, I have also introduced legislation and a constitutional amendment in the Senate last week to prevent federal courts from further interfering with any state’s Constitutionally-protected authority to define marriage.","2015-04-28 20:50:57+00","69983322463_10153255156987464",1],[1979,"Today 85,000 Baltimore city children will not be going to school.

We have to restore that trust and prove to the people we can make America safe again.\n\nEvery case deserves justice, and the facts surrounding Freddie Gray’s death should be thoroughly and impartially investigated. But rioting and mayhem are not the answer.\n\nWhile we continue to pray for a peaceful conclusion to the events in Baltimore–and pray for the families of those injured–I hope we all remember that our nation’s law enforcement consists of thousands of heroic officers who deeply respect the dignity of each person they serve to protect. Targeting law enforcement for violence is wrong, and it cannot be allowed to persist.\n\nLikewise, the small number of those who have wreaked destruction upon Baltimore over the past few days are not emblematic of the thousands of honest, hard-working families who are proud to call the city home.\n\nThere is, and has always been, far more to celebrate in America than to worry about.

President Obama’s approach gives the Castros exactly what they want – economic relief and legitimacy on the international stage – and effectively abandons the pro-U.S. opposition. This President has shown he is willing to do what nine previous presidents of both parties would not: cave to a communist dictator in our own hemisphere.\n\nThe President said today that his unprecedented meeting with Raul Castro was a step towards the future. Unfortunately, he is leaving the Cuban people imprisoned in the past.\n\nOf course we should look for new ways to bring relief to the people of Cuba, but if the United States is to provide an economic lifeline, we must first extract significant concessions. For instance, American fugitives being harbored in Cuba should be extradited. We should demand significant legal reform so that the Cuban government can no longer detain its citizens indefinitely with no process. We should demand that the political opposition to the Castros be included in any and all negotiations with Cuba, so their concerns will be addressed. And we should calibrate any relaxation of sanctions directly to the cessation of their human rights violations.\n\nIf Cuba will not show it can operate in good faith by making such changes before sanctions are lifted, we have no assurance that the Castros will take real action to improve the lives of their impoverished and oppressed citizens.

This year, on top of the frustrating reminder that Americans are giving too much of their income to fund too many wasteful government programs, families are now being forced to pay the Obamacare tax for the first time.\n\nInstead of government-run healthcare that increases taxes, limits options, and puts the government between patients and their doctors, imagine a free-market system that enables healthcare to be personal, portable and affordable. Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets Americans fill out their taxes on a postcard. Imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the IRS.\n\nMore of Americans’ hard-earned wages should be able to stay in their wallets so they can be free to invest more in their families and businesses, not in growing big government.\n\nTax reform is crucial to reversing our current economic stagnation, sparking economic growth, and expanding opportunity.

Toxic gasses filled the air; planes swooped below; and machine guns buzzed well into the night. In the first two days, the Division lost roughly 1,600 men. But they kept fighting, held the line, and captured over 600 enemy soldiers. The Texas troops forced the Germans to concede a primary stronghold, which proved to be a critical step in winning the war.\n\nA month later, on November 11, 1918, Germany signed an armistice ending the Great War, and ever since we have commemorated our veterans on this day.\n\nEach person who serves in the Armed Forces deserves our utmost gratitude – they pledge their lives so that we might remain free. Today we honor them.\n\nTexans have always been proud of our troops who, like those who charged the dark forest of Blanc Mont Ridge, defend liberty in the most harrowing circumstances.\n\nJust shy of a century since that most fateful night, the men and women of Texas continue to serve with great courage and commitment.\n\nNinety Texans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the United States’ highest recognition of personal bravery. Thousands have volunteered to defend our nation since 9-11, and hundreds have given their lives in the war against terrorism. In the past year, over 17,500 Texans have joined the Armed Forces. With over 200,000 active duty personnel, reservists, National Guardsmen, and civilians at 15 military institutions across the state, Texans play a critical role in keeping Americans safe and free.\n\nToday, service members from Dyess Air Force base are conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets. ISIS is the face of evil. It is persecuting Christians. It is beheading children. It is pillaging towns. And Dyess Air Force base is playing a critical role in exterminating this evil.\n\nToday, troops from Fort Bliss and Fort Hood are deploying to Africa and fighting the spread of what Texans have unfortunately already witnessed to be the deadly disease of Ebola. These soldiers are going into the thick of the epidemic and risking their own wellbeing to end this outbreak. We are grateful for their swift response.\n\nToday, the Texas National Guard has stepped up to secure the border and protect citizens from dangerous illegal criminals that only perpetuate the humanitarian crisis on the border. They are on the front lines of saving lives on American soil. In one case, just over a month ago, three National Guard soldiers rescued a Texan who was injured along the river. He was bleeding profusely, but with their swift response, he survived and has recovered.\n\nToday, bases from Shepperd to Goodfellow to Camp Bullis train our next generation of pilots, medics, and ground troops. Bases scattered throughout the state ensure that the future of our military is strong, and that the young men and women who pledge their lives to defend this nation are well-trained and equipped. These training programs provide them a future of service and opportunity, and in turn, these young soldiers safeguard our national security interests.\n\nToday we recognize a life-long Texan, Richard Overton, who at 108 is the oldest living American World War Two veteran – we thank him for his continued patriotism.\n\nThese are only a handful of examples highlighting the robust military presence in the Lone Star State.

But in Iran, an oppressive regime is inciting hatred against us as thousands chant “Death to America” as today is the 35th anniversary of when Iranian militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages for 444 days. This is the difference between America and Iran. Here we celebrate freedom; there they openly declare their desire to take it away from us.\n\nFor 35 years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been our enemy.  They have sponsored terrorist attacks that have murdered our citizens. They have threatened both the United States and our ally Israel with annihilation.  Every year on “Death to America Day” they declare this goal openly.  Yet right now the Obama Administration is desperately trying to compromise with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, which I fear could be a historic mistake.\n\nPlease vote today.

The American hostages were freed.\n\nToday we have the chance to take back control of the Senate. A strong Republican Congress can apply more pressure to stop the Obama Administration from striking a bad deal with Iran.\n\nAnd then, when Republicans win the White House in 2016, America will once again send the mullahs in Tehran an unmistakable signal that we will not tolerate their aggression and insults any more.","2014-11-04 17:20:13+00","69983322463_10152827179322464",1],[2269,"SD 10, Konni Burton needs your vote!","2014-11-04 15:15:46+00","69983322463_10152827004792464",1],[2271,"It's Election Day!

By refusing to rule if the States can define marriage, the Supreme Court is abdicating its duty to uphold the Constitution. The fact that the Supreme Court Justices, without providing any explanation whatsoever, have permitted lower courts to strike down so many state marriage laws is astonishing.\n\nThis is judicial activism at its worst. The Constitution entrusts state legislatures, elected by the People, to define marriage consistent with the values and mores of their citizens. Unelected judges should not be imposing their policy preferences to subvert the considered judgments of democratically elected legislatures.\n\nThe Supreme Court is, de facto, applying an extremely broad interpretation to the 14th Amendment without saying a word – an action that is likely to have far-reaching consequences. Because of the Court’s decision today, 11 States will likely now be forced to legalize same-sex marriage: Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. And this action paves the way for laws prohibiting same-sex marriage to be overturned in any state.\n\nIt is beyond dispute that when the 14th Amendment was adopted 146 years ago, as a necessary post-Civil War era reform, it was not imagined to also mandate same-sex marriage, but that is what the Supreme Court is implying today. The Court is making the preposterous assumption that the People of the United States somehow silently redefined marriage in 1868 when they ratified the 14th Amendment.\n\nNothing in the text, logic, structure, or original understanding of the 14th Amendment or any other constitutional provision authorizes judges to redefine marriage for the Nation. It is for the elected representatives of the People to make the laws of marriage, acting on the basis of their own constitutional authority, and protecting it, if necessary, from usurpation by the courts.\n\nMarriage is a question for the States. That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 2024, to protect the authority of state legislatures to define marriage. And that is why, when Congress returns to session, I will be introducing a constitutional amendment to prevent the federal government or the courts from attacking or striking down state marriage laws. \n\nTraditional marriage is an institution whose integrity and vitality are critical to the health of any society. We should remain faithful to our moral heritage and never hesitate to defend it.","2014-10-06 23:15:07+00","69983322463_10152761543252464",1],[2349,"Embracing the Great American Energy Renaissance empowered Texas to set record-breaking export numbers.

We perform different tasks, but the spirit is the same. We are proud of work and ashamed of idleness.  With us there is no task which is menial, no service which is degrading. All work is ennobling and all workers are ennobled.\"\n\nToday, too many Americans who want work are deprived of that opportunity.\n\nThe nominal unemployment rate is 6.2%.\n\nThe number of unemployed is 9.7 million.\n\nThe number of Americans who want work but have stopped looking is 2.2 million, and the number of discouraged Americans who have given up looking for work is 741,000.\n\nThe number of underemployed Americans is 19.4 million.  These are people who are unemployed (9.7 million), want work but have stopped searching for a job (2.2 million), or are working part time because they cannot find full time employment (7.5 million).\n\nThe labor force participation rate is 62.9 percent--the lowest level of participation since 1978.\n\nThe number of Americans not in the labor force is still over 92 million Americans, as 11,472,000 million Americans have left the workforce since President Obama took office.\n\nThese are not mere statistics—these represent real people, real families, people who have had their hopes and dreams crushed by a President and Democrats in Congress whose faith in Progressive politics will not be changed by the facts—their economic policies are a failure.\n\nWe can grow our way out of this problem. Ronald Reagan helped us do it in the 1980s and we can to it again now.\n\nIf the economy had recovered at the pace of Reagan’s recovery the  economy would be $2.2 trillion larger this year.  It's all because he put his faith in America's workers to make their own decisions that unleashed a new era of prosperity for the nation.\n\nPresident Obama has done the opposite and because of destructive Obama  policies, the economy has lost $6.4 trillion cumulatively since the recession ended--$20,388 per person.\n\nWe owe it to the American people to get the economy going again.  Many look for some silver bullet or innovative policy proposal, but it all goes to one basic question: Whom do you trust more, the the government, or the workers?\n\nI trust the workers. The American worker is what has made our nation the envy of the world. American workers create jobs, growth, and opportunities for themselves and the next generation. And, it is the American worker who deserves our confidence, support, and respect once again.","2014-09-01 13:10:46+00","69983322463_10152679754147464",1],[2432,"Watch the full speech from Americans for Prosperity's #Dream14 Summit here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j79QeW20APQ","2014-08-31 17:30:59+00","69983322463_10152677846147464",1],[2433,"Here we go at Americans for Prosperity's #Dream14 Summit!\n\nCouldn't catch it live?

Those men signified to the world that, although they yearned for peace, they would not submit to despots. Their demand for liberty offered no compromise.\n\nAs Thomas Jefferson later wrote, the Declaration was “an expression of the American mind”—one that refuses to accept insufferable evil, abuses, and usurpations and holds the freedom of its people supreme.\n\nThis is the spirit America was founded upon.\n\nThis is the heritage we all share.\n\nThis is what makes us Americans.\n\nMuch time has passed, but many of the challenges our forefathers faced have not changed. One doesn’t have to look very far on the world map to find nations where people suffer under brutal oppressors.\n\n“Terrorism” is an often-used word because the maiming and killing of innocents is so frequent. Suicide bombings, IEDs, mass killings, kidnappings, and hijackings are tools of their trade.\n\nHamas recently kidnapped and murdered three Jewish teenagers who were waiting for a bus to get home from school. They committed no wrong; they were targeted, forcibly taken, and shot.\n\nHundreds of girls remain missing in Nigeria, kidnapped by the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram.\n\nWe remember when Taliban forces shot Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenager because she was campaigning for girls' education. Courageously, she continues to advocate for it today.\n\nWe remember watching Neda Agha-Solten perish on the streets of Tehran during anti-government protests from a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nWe remember when the Syrian government gassed hundreds of beautiful, faultless, cherished children in their sleep last year, shocking the conscience of people around the world.\n\nAnd, there are countless others whose stories have not been told.\n\nMost of us, because we are Americans, will never have to suffer as these people and their families have. Thank God for the blessing of being an American and those who have fought and continue to fight to keep us free.\n\nAnd, remember, those Americans who are trapped, at this moment, in dark corners of the world.\n\nPastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, has been brutalized and remains imprisoned in Iran for merely sharing his Christian faith. Another American citizen, Kenneth Bae, is imprisoned in North Korea for also sharing his Christian faith. And, Meriam Ibrahim, a young mother who was forced to give birth with her legs in irons because she would not renounce her Christian faith, was kept in a Sudanese prison with her two small American children. Due to international outcry over their plight, they are finally out of jail, but are still waiting to experience real freedom in America.\n\nWe should never take our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for granted. Too much of the world does not recognize them. We must still hold these truths.\n\nJust as those brave men did 238 years ago, let us affirm our commitment to a government defined by consent of the people—a transformative concept that launched America into becoming the greatest force for freedom the world has ever seen.\n\nOn this Fourth of July raise up your American flags high and wave them proudly. The spirit of our star-spangled banner makes us who we are. That spirit keeps us strong, safe, and free.","2014-07-03 18:18:36+00","69983322463_10152544965142464",1],[2564,"Troubling report: HHS unable to verify citizenship of nearly 1.3M Obamacare enrollees. #FullRepeal","2014-07-02 18:51:06+00","69983322463_10152542929877464",1],[2566,"A new poll asked Americans who they thought was the best President since WWII: http://politi.co/1mTqmjy\n\nFirst place, by a wide margin, went to...","2014-07-02 15:29:33+00","69983322463_10152542590262464",1],[2567,"Inconceivable — I may like this movie even more now!

Its basic premise—that those in power must obey the law—is the foundation for constitutional liberty. Magna Carta said that a King is subject to the law, that he must abide by the law, that he cannot arbitrarily change the law by his own will, and that he is required to faithfully execute the law.\n\nThis hundreds of years old pact between England’s rulers and subjects is particularly meaningful now, as an increasingly imperial President has threatened our own freedoms.  For even though America’s most powerful documents--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights--have direct lineage to Magna Carta many of our nation’s leaders no longer seem to respect it.\n\nToday, let us pledge to support leaders who will revere these extraordinary documents and once again honor the rule of law.  It the difference between the success of nations and the fall of nations. History shows us that whenever animating principles of Magna Carta are celebrated freedom thrives; whenever they are disregarded tyranny rises.\n\nToday, on the 799th anniversary of Magna Carta, let us raise up our voices to demand our leaders fulfill the promise Magna Carta made so long ago.","2014-06-15 19:05:54+00","69983322463_10152504723697464",1],[2601,"This headline gets it right: \n\nDid The IRS Really Lose Lois Lerner's Emails?

Today, we commemorate that moment by thanking our veterans who have continued the quest to preserve our peace and freedom.\n\nWe should all be proud of our country’s long tradition of service. General John J. Pershing eloquently expressed his thanks in a letter to the troops who helped win the “war to end all wars,” that is just as relevant now as it was then.\n\nPershing wrote, “By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor, strength and indomitable will, made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation, you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.”\n\nWe are so fortunate that throughout history, millions of Americans have come forward to fight tyrants, fascists, communists, and terrorists to keep us free.\n\nStill, we live in a violent world, where the freedoms we enjoy remain exceptional to millions of less fortunate forced to abide by brutal dictators, oppressive regimes, and cultures of intolerance.\n\nThe persistent threats of terrorism at home and abroad are reminders of how precious it is to be an American and how fiercely our rights must be protected.\n\nWe are blessed to live in a society where men and women continue to fight for our flag. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, more than 3 million Americans have volunteered to defend their country, knowing full well the risks they may face. More than 50,000 are serving in Afghanistan right now.\n\nThey, like millions of veterans before them, are willingly putting themselves in danger to keep us safe.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge once said, “The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.” He was right.\n\nPlease join me on this Veterans Day in saying a prayer of thanks for our veterans. And, please find a veteran. Grab their hand. Look them in the eye and tell them, “Thank you for your service.”\n\nWe will never be able to express enough thanks for the troops, but they must always know they are treasured.\n\nMay God bless the veterans, may God bless all those who continue to protect our country, and may God bless the United States of America.","2013-11-11 16:55:37+00","69983322463_10152037384232464",1],[3093,"I'll be a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno this evening.

Given that the President did not request an emergency session of Congress, that must mean that he agrees there is no imminent threat requiring the Commander in Chief to act without consulting the representatives of the American people.\n\nI remain concerned that the mission proposed by the President is not in furtherance the vital national security interests of the United States. To date I have heard a great deal from the administration about punishing Bashir al-Assad for violating an “international norm” through the use of chemical weapons, and that this is why we must act against him. Abstract notions about international norms should never displace U.S. sovereignty to act, or refuse to act, for our national security.\n\nAssad’s murderous actions have claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand of his own people, which is a humanitarian tragedy. But our chief strategic concern should not be international norms; it should be preventing the chemical weapons from falling into the hands of al Qaeda or other terrorists who might use them against us and our allies.\n\nIt is now incumbent upon President Obama to make his case and persuade Congress that his plan is necessary, and the best course to preserve our security and protect our liberties. Like the President, I welcome this debate and I agree this is an issue of the highest seriousness that transcends partisan politics.","2013-08-31 19:47:38+00","69983322463_10151871825737464",1],[3226,"FACT: Obamacare's “essential health benefit” standards will likely make your health care plan more expensive.\n\n#DontFundIt #DefundObamacare","2013-08-30 23:57:00+00","69983322463_10151869923137464",1],[3227,"FACT: Obamacare puts millions onto Medicaid as more and more physicians refuse to accept new Medicaid patients.\n\n#DontFundIt #DefundObamacare","2013-08-30 01:08:17+00","69983322463_10151868047587464",1],[3229,"Great to speak with Rush Limbaugh about the fight to #DefundObamacare. \n\nWe need a grassroots tsunami to win -- are you with us?","2013-08-29 01:16:08+00","69983322463_10151866145677464",1],[3232,"If we're going to #AbolishtheIRS and #DefundObamacare, it's going to have to come from the people!\n\nAre you with us?","2013-08-28 01:02:00+00","69983322463_10151864268572464",1],[3234,"On action in Syria, Secretary Kerry and the President have said they want to go to the United Nations for approval.

But that penalty does not apply to those with RPI status, giving a powerful incentive for job creators to hire illegal immigrants instead of U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. That is indefensible.

The Berlin came wall down because an American President distilled his policy towards the Soviet Union into a simple formula: “We win, they lose.”\n\nIf history be our guide, although the notion of “peace with justice” that the President mentioned ten times in his speech may sound appealing, we will be far better served by President Reagan’s policy of “peace through strength,” which cannot be achieved by appeasement or yet another round of nuclear cuts by the Obama administration.","2013-06-20 00:40:00+00","69983322463_10151721015822464",1],[3391,"Sequester?

Some went to a recruiting center to assist the young people who, like so many before them, would walk through the door on any given Thursday morning and volunteer to defend the United States of America. Four brave Marines went to a Naval Reserve Center to perform their duties to the Tennessee National Guard.\n\nBut one of the young people who visited two of those facilities was not like the others. He was there not to volunteer to serve America, but to attack America. Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was there to carry out jihad, an act of radical Islamic terrorism. An act of war, in which those four brave Marines lost their lives, while at least two others were wounded.\n\nIn the wake of this vicious attack on our nation we need to rid ourselves of two dangerous delusions, first and foremost that a \"lone gunman\"–as President Obama described the shooter–is somehow isolated from the larger threat of radical Islamic terrorism. In the modern world, no one acts in isolation. Through social media ISIS, al Qaida and other groups are infiltrating our nation with impunity while our government will not even admit that radical Islamic terrorism is a problem.\n\nThe second delusion is that this attack is somehow isolated from previous episodes, notably those in Little Rock, Arkansas and Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009—both of which were attacks on American military facilities. The Obama administration was woefully reluctant to call either an act of radical Islamic terrorism, instead suggesting \"workplace violence\" as a justification for the killings. Finally, after years of effort, the victims of Fort Hood were properly recognized as victims of attacks by foreign terrorists when they received Purple Hearts on April 15, 2015. Likewise, the victim of the Little Rock attack received a Purple Heart on July 1, 2015.\n\nWe cannot afford wait six years to recognize what happened yesterday in Chattanooga for what it was. We need to see with clarity right now what has happened. We can immediately hold hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee on the need for our enlisted men and women to have the right to be armed in military facilities. Congress can pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act that would allow our government to stop Americans who travel overseas to train with terrorist groups from coming back to attack us at home. We can thoroughly overhaul our broken immigration system that is allowing this type of individual to gain citizenship. And we can accept the reality that while we might wish it otherwise, the forces of radical Islam are at war with us.","2015-07-17 18:26:07+00","69983322463_10153445558042464",1],[3975,"The Texas \u0026 Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association knows firsthand that we have got to stop the Obama Administration's abusive enforcement of environmental laws. \r\n\r\nLIKE if you agree!","2012-09-26 17:02:08+00","69983322463_10151233474477464",1],[3976,"San Antonio Area Friends: Quick reminder about TONIGHT's fundraising reception in San Antonio to support our campaign and help send a proven conservative to the US Senate.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to join us, it's not too late to RSVP!
