The 28 year old Jamaican has been feeling discomfort in his left leg since his last competition which has restricted his training.  He visited Doctor M√ºller-Wohlfahrt in Munich who confirmed that he has a blocked sacroiliac joint which is restricting his movement and putting pressure on his knee and ankle.  Usain will spend the next couple of days in Munich getting treatment after which he will resume full training in his quest to defend his titles at the IAAF World T\u0026F Championships in Beijing at the end of August.\n\n\"I'm disappointed not to be able to compete in Paris and Lausanne.

Unfortunately due to the training that I missed I am behind where I am at normally at this time of year and will not be ready to race in the Ostrava Golden Spike meet or Meeting Areva in Paris.  These are great events that I have competed in many times in the past and I plan to run in many times in the future.  I have a lot of support in both countries and always get a good reception there.\n \nI hope to be back in competition soon but how soon will depend on my training in the next few weeks.  It is important for me to take my time this year as I have three tough years ahead in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as I attempt to defend my World and Olympic titles.  I definitely plan to compete this season and will continue to work hard with my coach who I have the utmost confidence in to get me fit and ready to compete.
