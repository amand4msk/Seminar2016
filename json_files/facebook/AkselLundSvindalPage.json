When you´re not competing and being in full action, there´s just not that much happening. Travelling around skiing and competing with the best in the world gives you a lot more to write about.  \n   The good thing about not racing is that you get to meet a lot of new people. Like the crew at the Royal Norwegian Air Force.  Taking me for a trip in the F-16. That´s something that I´ve always wanted to check out. And what better time to get an invite than when you´re stuck on the sofa.  A very kind thing to do and an awesome experience. Sitting in a F-16 is almost surrealistic. Like you´re a part of a video game. And when you´re flying over beautiful Norwegian landscape, then the scenery is almost the best part. Moving fast being able to cover a lot of ground, and still seeing everything crystal clear through the canopy.  And I´ve now been travelling supersonic! Check! There´s some risk involved. But doing extreme things with very good people never scares me that much. That means the risk is lower than it appears. I always find “normal” activities with unfocused and untrained people much more scary.\n   Since then I´ve spent my time on Florida. Relaxing on the beach, visiting friends, fishing, boating and working on my rehab training. I´ve had a great time here, and the rehab progress is going well. I´ll go back to Europe for some spring time later, but for now Florida has been perfect. Getting a mix of the tourist beach feeling and the local feeling staying with people that live here. Time goes by faster under the sun when you cant use the winter for skiing anyway.","2016-04-02 14:20:23+00","33567326992_10153371437946993",1],[2,"Last spring we had a brainstorming session around how to connect downhill speed with fast wireless connection. This turned into a crazy idea with the potential to make a downhill gold medal into much more than a trophy hanging on the wall. This has been an exciting project.

The Youth Olympic games happening right now. That´s gotta be an amazing experience for a young athlete. Wish I was able to take part in something like that when i was a kid. \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdBQS8lp4xY","2016-02-13 21:26:34+00","33567326992_10153252850591993",1],[5,"Its been almost two weeks since I went down hard in Kitzbühel. 10 days of a lot of lying in bed and sitting on the sofa. So here we go. A few reflections I’ve done.\n\n-Shit happens!, and when it does it happens fast. One minute you´re in the starting gate thinking how you can gain a few hundreds of a second through a downhill turn. Before you know it you´re in the hospital wondering how many months till I can walk normally again. That’s the way it is. You can only deal with the things you can actually do something about. And that’s usually what´s right in front of you. Be well prepared to deal with anything, but don’t worry about stuff you can´t influence or things you can´t possibly see coming.\n\n-Walk it off! Sounds good, but doesn’t really work. I tried it, and that’s just the adrenalin walking. My knee was still busted, and by the time I got to the hospital I couldn’t take a single step. But to be honest, that’s not really the reason you do it. Knowing that there´s a lot of people watching you race, and a lot of them friends and family. It is always best to show that you´re ok, if you are. Downhill crashes can look real bad, and in the bigger picture a knee is not that serious. If you can, give a signal you´re ok. If you get helicoptered out of there, it always takes hours before friends and family get any news about your condition. \n\n-Good people are awesome. I´ve said this before, but it strikes me every time. It´s always nice to be around good people. But when things don’t go that well, that’s when it goes from nice to crucial. I´m thinking of everyone. The medical personnel that take are of you on the hill and at the hospital, your team and team mates, sponsors and your ski company, and of course friends and family! Thanks.\n\n-Rehab training feels brutal at first. You´re used to being an athlete, and all of a sudden it feels more like being a patient. But then you start appreciating small steps and improvement, an then is actually not that bad. \n\n-I usually go down hard when I´m skiing my best. And so have a lot of other athletes. Bad luck??? No, I don’t believe it is. In downhill racing(and a lot of other sports) there will always be an element of risk. Something we all know about and that we´re used to. Part of your job as an athlete is to be willing to accept this risk and push the limit so that you can go faster. To be able to win races you need to be good at overcoming your negative thoughts and be able to take enough risk. I´m not necessarily a big risk seeker. So I need to convince my self that it´s worth taking the risk. Taking risk when the possible outcome is winning the race, that’s a much better risk/reward ratio than when you´re not in a position to win. So when the price is bigger, I have an easier time convincing myself that it´s worth pushing hard. \n\n-So now it´s back to rehab training. Do I have the motivation to go trough another rehab in just over a year? I do! With skiing as the ultimate goal of course. But there´s also a lot of other things. I want to drop the crutches as fast as I can. I wanna walk on a beach, and ride my bike somewhere cool. I wanna lift weights and do heavy workouts. To get there as fast as possible it´s all the same method. Good rehab training is the answer to all these!","2016-02-05 18:02:36+00","33567326992_10153238426516993",1],[6,"When a bunch of downhill racers end up at the hospital at the same time.

Add the fact that Henrik is kicking ass in slalom, and we´re looking at some exciting times for the Attacking Vikings. Great to be a member of this team!! As for the last few days, they’ve been very relaxing with family. Like Christmas should be. Enjoyed a quick birthday breakfast before I dropped my dad and brother off at the airport in Innsbruck.

Not sure what it was, but it was a brutal one. Today I did warm up and inspection before the GS race. But still have some stomach issues and a fever, so decided to pull the plug. Ups and downs. And that´s all good when the ups are good enough to win races;) Better be 100% when the downhill tour starts in Europe again.  And that means I wont be travelling to Val d Isere either.

For a skier that means the winter is almost here. From the end of August till April is all about snow, winter and skiing. Getting as much as possible of  it in the fall, and then make the most out of it when the winter arrives in Europe/North America. So you better enjoy the summer days that you do get. And I have. It´s been a busy summer. Busy training with the guys on the team, travelling around Europe and also spending a few perfect lazy summer days at the family cabin. I´ve also spent a lot of time working on some other projects that have nothing to do with skiing. Trying to learn some other skills and checking out what other exciting stuff this world has to offer. The time that I was injured gave me the opportunity to get to know some new people, and I really enjoy spending time with them and talking about everything else but sports. Sports and skiing is for sure still number one. And most important right now is that I´m healthy and looking forward to the winter. Right now I´m at a ski camp at Passe Stelvio Italiy. The achilles feels so good inside the ski boot that I don’t even think about it any more.  And physically I´m close to the same level that I was before the injury. Thanks to my team mates. “The Attacking Vikings”. Those guys impress me everyday. Great attitude and they´re starting to look super strong.

That’s what has priority, and when you cant be a part of that, you find your own way. Not completely by yourself, but its more or less up to yourself to make the best out of the situation. But not anymore. Feels great to be 100% back with the team again. Being healthy enough to take part in the normal everyday activity and not slowing anyone down. We have a couple of good camps and we´ve started the summer dryland training. Was hoping for some good skiing in Austria this week, but weather not cooperating at the moment. But I´ll keep my eyes open for some more skiing. I´ve got some work to do to catch up what I lost this winter! The physical condition is good. I was able to get a lot of good physical training even with the cast on my foot. In fact I was back at my normal maxium squat(leg strength) level just weeks after loosing the cast.

The whole process of trying to get ready in time was one big challenge. I like challenges. And in the end it worked out, but with a margin of only a day or two. It was probably pushing it a little bit to ski in the world champs. But I felt it was under control. Ever since I left Beaver Creek I´ve been thinking a lot about what to do with the rest of the season.  How I feel on skis being my number one priority. How the injury looks being the number one priority for the medical team. The other aspect is what risks I´m taking with my starting positions for next year. As we all know start numbers make a big difference in ski racing. I feel pretty good on the skis, but I also feel that I missed those three months of skiing. To be back 100% I will need a lot more skiing, but if everything runs perfect I think it would be possible to do some good races. Achilles also looks good. But as the guys at the Olympic center in Oslo said, “you still have three months of rehab training left, dont forget that!”. And then we have the aspect with the staring position. To describe it simple it works something like this; If you are injured you get injury status. An injury is something that FIS says it takes 8 months to recover from. So if you´re back quicker, then you get no injury status. This means that if I start skiing World Cup now I´m not injured and never was. And that means I have the last few races of the season to try and collect the same ranking points that the other guys have used the whole winter to collect. If I don’t collect them I will start next season with a bad start number. I have done the math, and it would be possible to make it happen. But that is if everything runs perfect. Including weather and other factors that I cant control, because I couldn’t afford any races being cancelled. So between the math and good advice from people I trust I have landed on the decision that I will use the rest of this winter to get back to good old shape. In other words no more races. Both skiing and physical rehab needs a lot more work. And this way I have the time to get it done right. Come to the beginning of next season fully prepared and be ready to attack 100% again. Thanks for the support during world champs. That meant a lot!! And it was almost unreal to be back way earlier then I expected. But back at Olympic center it was clearly back to reality. 3 more months of rehab training…\n\nAksel","2015-02-18 14:42:24+00","33567326992_10152584499281993",1],[40,"Another close race here in Beaver Creek.

So September is probably the most important month of the year when it comes to actually getting better. And I think we did get better in this year. Like always in the mountains there´s a lot of weather and changing conditions. But staying for a month you´re pretty much guarantied to get some good, and then it doesn’t matter if its not great for a week or two.

That kinda changes once you reach world cup level. There are so many races, that there is very little room for training days. And during a race day there is more talking about skiing then there is actual skiing. In the morning you inspect the course for about an hour. Then you talk to the coaches. Watch some of the other racers and get feedback from your coaches again after they’ve seen a few guys. Then you finally get to ski yourself, but only one or two runs during the day. And then you spend time talking to the media about those few minutes of skiing. Before you look at your run again in the evening and talk to the coaches about how to get better. Its all exciting and competition is fun. But there is not a lot of actual skiing during a race season. Most of the skiing you want to get done needs to happen during summer and fall. But now that I´m not doing races I have way more time to just ski. I´ve been skiing almost every day since I was able to put a ski boot on around mid January. It´s back to how thing used to be when I was a junior, and I like it a lot. Training with the junior team, the Europa cup team and the slalom guys. Like in the picture when Kjetil Lars and I were working our way up. Getting lots of skiing done and working on the technique more than looking at the times and thinking about speed.  Getting a reminder of how fun the pure skiing is, without lots of people around and getting attention from media etc. It´s fun and I think it’s a great way to start preparing for next winter.

I didn't ski for three whole months while these other guys were racing around the world.\n\nBut I'm not taking anyone else's spot in the championships. I have my own spot cause I'm the defending champion. So I guess this time it's more for the love of the game. I miss the action.

This was of course way too optimistic, so I was a bit disappointed. But now its slowly getting there. Still problems in rough conditions, but that too keeps getting better. This week I can almost follow a normal training, so I´ve joined up with parts of the team in Hinterreit Austria. Feels great to be back with the boys.

I´ll fly over on Sunday and then I get almost a week of skiing in Aspen before I have to decide of I´m ready to do races at the world champs or not. Its still far away, but the progress is promising.

And when you´re an athlete and that “shit” is an injury, then your life is changed until you´re a 100% recovered. It´s for sure not the end of the world, but you´re life just looks a lot different the next weeks or months. So what to do? I found no positive side to this situation within my world, the world of sports. So I started looking for other alternatives that I find interesting and inspiring.  \n     Trough my career I´ve gotten to know a lot of great people in different fields and environments. And trough this I´ve learned that entrepreneurs, people that start their own businesses and companies, think a lot like athletes do. They set high goals that are hard to reach, but they´re willing to take the risk and reach for their goals. And they often do so with energy and passion that I recognize from sports. So I quickly realized that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to keep my mind occupied while I´m doing (boring) rehab training.  Spending time with experienced (and hopefully smart!) entrepreneurs. Have fun, get inspired and maybe learn something at the same time. And where do you find an environment that´s full of experienced entrepreneurs?? The Bay Area. San Francisco and Silicon Valley is home to some of the biggest companies and most innovative companies in the world. Companies who´s product we use every day. Like Facebook and Google. But more important, it´s full of innovative companies driven by people with a passion and a vision to create what could be the as important as Google 10 years from now. \n     Thanks to a little help for some good friends in Oslo, some new friends I made a long the way, and a very open and welcoming culture here in Silicon Valley, this trip was everything I hoped it would be. Very inspiring, lots of fun, and filled with lessons to learn.  I have spent every day with people I had never met before, but that were still willing to share both their time and their experiences.  At companies like Google, or at some café with someone willing to risk everything on an idea that’s just on a piece of paper. Both with same enthusiasm and conviction that they´re working on something big. \n     I hope that I´ve learned something.  I like this “industry of big ideas” a lot. And that’s probably the most important lesson. That this is something that I have fun with. Cause when you´re having fun you´re working harder and better. That´s something that I believe will never change.  Hard work pays off! \n     So if you´re walking around somewhere on this planet, and you have a great idea in your mind. Or a feeling in your stomach that you want to create something. Explore that idea and see what´s possible. Don’t keep it a secret, cause trough sharing and conversations you´ll probably attract others with a similar mindset. And that is the first lesson I learned here. There´s thousands of great ideas and the competition is big. What can separate you is having a great team of people and being able to execute on your idea. \n     I had good friends helping me out to get started. But I have met just as many inspiring people just staying in the area. The Nordic countries have put together a shared working space called the Nordic Innovation House. A great place were I´ve spent a lot of time. So if you´re from the Nordic region you´ll have a great start right there.  And I´m sure other countries have similar projects. So if you have that entrepreneur spirit and you wanna give it a chance. Go explore! Only then will you know what´s possible.  That´s my conclusion. But be aware, right now I might be under the influence of some of the best entrepreneurs in the world ;)","2014-12-23 10:22:36+00","33567326992_10152457244496993",1],[53,"JOY and smiles all around;)  Go to the HEAD Facebook page to see how you can win a pair of the brand new JOY skis.  #smilesofjoy","2014-12-05 09:23:29+00","33567326992_10152422119766993",1],[55,"Rehab update\n\nThanks to a lot of good support and some hard work I´m happy to say that the rehab training is going very well. This week I’m gonna loose this plastic cast that I’ve been walking around with lately. That means the achilles tendon itself is slowly growing back to be one piece. But its still not the same strength. But that’s an even bigger problem with the muscles in my leg and around the ankle. Even though I’ve been working them every day, that is still nothing compered to how you use your muscles when you´re just moving around without a cast on. So even though the cast thing is coming off, I suspect I still have to walk with the crutches for a few days. And that’s kind of a good thing. Cause once you get a good technique on those things they´re real fast.   But even though I have a way to go I´m pretty optimistic. I do have a feeling I´m a little ahead of schedule. So lets wait and see what happened in the next few months. The achillies tendon is about double of what it used to be in thickness, so i´m gonna have to drop by the Head factory to get a new pair of boots fitted.

Add being in the mountains and you´re effected by a lot of weather.  During my time as a ski racer I have been to many camps where the weather and conditions have not been on our side. It´s almost normal that you lose a few days and/or get some days with real bad conditions. Bad conditions as a ski racers usually means that the snow is bad. It can be very soft. Or the snow is braking up into balls(we call it death cookies). Or its just hard enough for cruising, but once you push hard it breaks away under your ski. Or it is just very little snow. Very little snow means rocks. Since rocks destroy your skis, you can´t use your race skis. And training if you can´t use your best equipment is not the same. Snow in general is very sensitive to weather conditions. But you´re also depending on the crew that work the hill. That they know what they´re doing when they´re running the groomers. Basically there is a lot of things that can easily mess up your training. Imagine being a football player. One day the grass is just dirt and hard as asphalt , one day it´s half a meter tall and the next day its so wet that you run with water over your ankles. You can still practice, but its not very game/match/race like, you cant be your best and after a while that gets old. And that’s just the snow. Add wind(sometimes so strong the lifts wont run), rain, snow and fog. All normal in the mountains. There are just a lot of things that would make a lot of other sports easier when it comes to getting good training. If I go somewhere I like to stay for a long time. This way I feel you minimize the luck when it comes to weather. Staying long enough in one place you´re gonna get good stuff sooner or later. That´s why we spend the whole month of September(and then some) in Argentina. Like I said, going somewhere for a week you need some luck, and you could easily lose half of your days or more. But going somewhere for a month and having shit conditions almost every day!!! That’s a first for me. And hopefully a last…  Coaches, ski technicians and racers are all working hard and hoping every day for good conditions.  When you get disappointed by what the weather has done to the conditions almost every day you come up on the mountain… Well, it gets frustrating in the end. This September in Ushuaia most be the worst ski camp I´ve ever been to. We have just had real bad luck, for a month straight… Hopefully that will change for October and November, so we can get some quality training and be ready for another fun winter season!!

Good thing these months were both amazing in Scandinavia this year. In June I spent most of my time in Oslo training with the team. I a few short trips to Innsbruck and some days at my summer house in Sweden. But most of the time was spent with the team working out. Good times and good workouts. A win win situation thanks to great team mates!\n    We got three weeks of vacation from the team. The first week I spent with friends from New York biking trough the French Alps. We started in Annecy and ended up on the Riviera. That´s something I would recommend to everyone. If you like biking, beautiful nature and a bit of a challenge you should try that some day. Two relaxing days on the Riviera felt real good after climbing some of the most famous mountain passes in the Alps. I´m for sure doing that again!\n   Then I spent two weeks at my house in Sweden in the craziest summer weather I have ever experienced in Scandinavia. High 20´s to mid 30´s every day.

Doing something different. And after 5-6 months with intense skiing and very little time for lifting, it is actually fun to get back to the gym and do something different. It sure doesnt always feel that way. So better take advantage and get a lot of training done now that I´m feeling excited about it. But this week is all about skiing. Getting a lot of good turns done!","2014-04-30 12:20:02+00","33567326992_10152008828171993",1],[73,"After a long winter with lots of skiing, then there is more skiing… We have started the training for next season. Just spent a week in Kvitfjell with great conditions. If you´re lucky in and get good weather in the spring, you get great conditions in the morning before that sun heats everything up too much.  Last week was some of the best conditions I have seen all winter. Now its off to Åre Sweden for a HEAD camp. HEAD athletes gathered to test next years equipment. Always fun to see of we can find something that’s faster than what we have. We usually do! We will also be recording some material for next year. A new film. Last year´s “poker” film was a big hit so we need something good again this year.","2014-04-07 05:56:17+00","33567326992_10151965414871993",1],[75,"Its been a while since I wrote anything on this blog. The last part of the season was draining. In the race season you don’t ski that much during the winter. You do some warm up and freeskiing, but the actual skiing in races is always less then 5 minutes. And when you´ve finished your 5 min of skiing you get to talk about it with the media for about 1 hour and 5 minutes. That doesn’t mean that the media is bad. But I´m a skier. And 5 min of skiing followed by 1 hour and 5 min talking about skiing is gets tiring after a long winter. So I haven’t\nreally had the energy to wright about skiing either. But now I´ve spent some time alone, or at least away from most people. So now I´m back. First I skied a little in the Swiss alps, then I went to Austria to climb the Grossglockner. A fun experience. A lot of people go to the summit of Grossglockner. I think that is impressive, cause the last part is challenging. A narrow spine to climb and walk with something that looks like 1000 meters vertical on both sides. Sure get your heart pumping a little faster.  And with this new energy that I got from spending some time “alone” in the mountains I´m heading to Norway for the national championships. Hope you all have a great last part of the winter and try to get more then 5 minutes of skiing a day!","2014-03-23 09:41:48+00","33567326992_10203528363193429",1],[76,"","2014-03-13 12:38:46+00","33567326992_10201647073914733",1],[77,"Last WC Super G in Lenzerheide in a few minutes (9.30)!

I´m on the Norwegian Junior Ski Team and we are at Folgefonna glacier in Norway training. There is a new kid around. Lars Myhre. He´s not apart of the team, but he has skied so well with his school that he is invited to join us for training. Immediately he kicks our ass with an all-in full gas intensity that I had never seen. And that´s it. He skis so well that he makes the team right there and then. As the only room left in the house that we are renting is in my tiny double bed(I´m taking euro tiny, way smaller than American queen size), Lars still stays with his school for that camp. And this is something Lars and I have disagreed on ever since. Did he not move in because I said NO this bed is too small for the two of us??, or didn’t he want to move in because the bed was too small. Hahaha! What was it Lars?? \r\nAnd since that summer day in 2000 Lars has been my team mate and one of my best friends. Later that season Kjetil Jansrud also made the Junior team. And it has been the three of us that made it every step from that team and to world championships and Olympics. Good races, bad races, but most off all just a lot of fun!\r\nAfter a back injury last season Lars has been struggling. It´s sad that he is stopping his career. But the good news for all of you people out there is that he is a great guy and an excellent commentator on TV. Just hired by TV2 to cover the Olympics and some of the biggest races. So you all will see a lot more of him! Enjoy! I´m looking forward to seeing Lars at the races in Beaver Creek.","2013-11-19 15:08:00+00","33567326992_10151718152261993",1],[141,"","2013-11-13 22:00:37+00","33567326992_10151706179126993",1],[142,"","2013-11-13 21:42:06+00","33567326992_10151706135221993",1],[144,"Photo from the SWIX - your winning margin magazine","2013-11-10 22:00:16+00","33567326992_10151700910416993",1],[146,"Oakley 2013 ski porn edit","2013-11-10 00:57:22+00","33567326992_10151699434481993",1],[148,"Suit up one last time.

So after spending another great summer together we have decided that we want to try going our separate ways. I usually don’t share a lot from my private life, but there you go.

It´s been a very active summer. Lots of normal training, but also lots of other activities.  One or two workout session a day plus surfing, sailing, biking and playing means a lots of calories burned. I eat healtier in the summer than the winter. Being able to make your own food or choosing what restaurant to eat at gives me the option to eat better. Travelling the world during the winter this can be tougher. But maybe not better for a downhill skier?? During the testing at the Olympic center I discovered I had lost 4 kilos. As gravity is my motor, I need all the kilos and horsepower I can get trying to go faster. \n\nBut do not fear. I know I will get back to 100 kilos in no time.  The last 10 days I have tried eating more and adding some more calories to my diet.

My feelings then were very different from what they are now. I was young, inexperienced, skinny and did not no what I was facing. I knew the legend of Kitzbuhel and I had seen the race in TV, but I had no idea what the course actually looked like up close. I was more of a slalom/giant slalom skier back then. But then I got a 6th place at the worldcup Super G in Val Gardena, and just like that I was  a speed skier as well.  I remember that day I was told by my coaches that I should race the Kitzbuhel downhill.  “The downhill in Kitzbuhel is similar to the Super G, you should race it to be prepared”. I said ok, and for the next two weeks that was just about all I could think about. The unknown is a lot worse than knowing what you´re facing. When we got to Kitbuhel I walked around town, up to the finish area and into some fields to try to get a look at the course. That didn’t help much. I remember there were some forerunners testing the track, and they were crashing all over the place.  Not exactly what I hoped to see. But after the first inspection I felt better. I knew what I had to do and I could focus my energy on that. That being said I was incredibly nervous in the start gate. But that´s a part of the game, and I would lie if I said I´m not nervous this week. But this time I am a lot better prepared, and I´m ready to fight for the great Kitzbuhel victory. So wish me luck and lets hope for a weekend of fair and fun racing.","2013-01-24 16:48:11+00","33567326992_10151215660786993",1],[234,"Not how I wanted my weekend in Wengen to end..","2013-01-19 13:56:29+00","33567326992_520450594642392",1],[236,"Wengen SC after 1st run: 1.

Thanks to some of the best people in the world.\nBeing born on the 26th of the December is not very convenient if you´re a worldcup ski racer and you like celebrating your birthday with good friends. I usually spend my birthday alone in a car driving to Bormio. Kinda sad, but missing out on a worldcup race would be worse. So I´m used to this being the way things are. And I could always have birthday parties when I´m done racing. But this year I´m turning 30 on the 26th. (I know, its kinda old and kinda scary!!) And it just seems very wrong to spend that day alone in a car.  I wanted to do something, but figured I would make up for it in the spring. Arranging a party at Christmas can be tough. Everyone´s busy with chrsitmas stuff, travelling etc. So when my brother said there was this new great restaurant right in the neighborhood, I didt think anything of it. Him, Julia and I walked over to grab something to eat, I thought… Door opening and SURPRISE!!!!  Lots of my best friends and family. Couldn’t have been better. Birthday party. A few days early, but still awesome. And the best thing about it is that you get to see all the people you wanna see, but there is just noe way you can when you only have three days in Norway.
