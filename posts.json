He will undoubtedly kill me fo posting this particular picture but I've gotten good over the past 4 decades in dealing with his playful wrath. Here we are pictured at Disneyland on the Cars ride with his daughter and my niece Zelah. I've often said that I was blessed growing up with three parents. Cary is just two years older but always was one of my greatest guardians, mentors, teachers and friends. He is truly the epitome of a gentle man, one of the kinder people I know with a depth of goodness and decency in his soul that overflows endlessly into the world. I remember in 1984 I was playing my first varsity football game as a sophomore in High School. It was opening day for Old Tappan, our big game against our rival Demarest. My brother was a lineman and I was a wide receiver. On one play, I shot downfield on a post pattern, the quarterback, Matt Nalbandian,  unloaded a bomb to me. I laid out for the pass catching it right before it hit the ground but the referee called it incomplete. To this day I know I caught that pass and at 15 I was outraged at the injustice of the ref. I got up and began yelling at the official but before I could get far into my tantrum someone grabbed me from behind and dragged me back. It was my brother and he lit into me with a rare ferocity of tone telling me unequivocally that I was to NEVER argue with an official. He dragged me back down field yelling at me about conduct, honor, and attitude: even if I was right about the catch, I was dead wrong in how I was behaving. That was the first and last time I ever raised my voice, argued, or disrespected a referee, no matter how much I may have believed they got something wrong, in my football career. This is my big brother: a man who taught me about manhood; that strength is ultimately not about the physical or about how loud you raise your voice but about how honorable you are, how you treat others and by how well you exhibit grace in this world no matter what the circumstances. Today I celebrate my brothers birth and the incredible life of love he is living.

And then when people are released we heap upon them lifetime punishments that make it so hard or impossible to get a job, a PELL grant to go to college, a loan, housing, food stamps, to vote, to get certain business licenses and so much more. Further, our drug war disproportionately targets the poor and minorities and fails to adequately help the addicted or mentally ill who are also disproportionately incarcerated.

Aphasia is a neurological disorder caused by damage to portions of the brain responsible for language. We have over a million people in the United States living with Aphasia. Roughly we have 800,000 annual stroke victims, a significant number of whom will have Aphasia. The Adler Center is a vital service for people with Aphasia and their families.  Their therapeutic environment provides rehabilitation services, educational programs, family support and more. For so many it is a lifeline to greater strength, stability and higher well being. Unfortunately they struggle every year depending on private generosity for 85% of their funding. Their critical services should be available to all and because of their work with members, the services they provide help reduce other societal costs needed for their care - arguably saving tax dollars as they empower people to rehabilitate and contribute.  I believe we can and should do more to support centers like this.  I also believe and have called for more investment in medical research. I have specifically been focused on brain injuries and disorders from my AL-TBI bill to my focus on challenges from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's and the need to invest more for a cure.  @Adleraphasiacenter", "published": "2016-03-30T18:13:38Z", "idPost": "1217535963542931261_20158920"}}, {"model": "polls.post", "pk": 408, "fields": {"person": 13, "message": "Opioid addiction has taken a devastating toll on families in New Jersey and across the country. According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioid overdose deaths hit an all-time high in 2014. The number of unintentional overdose deaths from prescription pain relievers has soared in the United States in recent years, more than quadrupling since 1999. We cannot stand by idly and watch this growing epidemic jeopardize the health and welfare of so many of our friends and neighbors. \nThe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, recently passed by the Senate, will authorize a number of grants to boost opioid prevention and education programs, and help address the opioid addiction crisis that our country is facing. It's a step forward, but we need to do much more to combat the growing epidemic. Expanding education efforts, increasing the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help treat overdoses, offering more effective treatment to the incarcerated, and creating monitoring systems to prevent the growth of addiction will all help heal our communities. We have work to do. Awareness is a critical step and increased action must follow. The Serenity Prayer starts, \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; \ncourage to change the things I can; \nand wisdom to know the difference.\" The crisis with Opioids is something we must not not accept. Together we must have the courage to change this painful reality, we must each summon the courage and will to do something to help.
